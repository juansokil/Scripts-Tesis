Design/methodology/approach – Based on a relational perspective on gender shifting attention to a field, habitus, and capital-based view on careers, the paper analyses the interrelation of gender, gender role type (GRT) and income with a longitudinal two-cohort design of business school graduates (1990, 2000), using mixed linear models. Findings – In line with the authors' argumentation, female or undifferentiated GRT earn less than masculine or androgynous GRT in both cohorts over time, and relative income of androgynous compared to masculine men is higher in the 2000 cohort than in the 1990 cohort. Contrary to the authors' hypotheses, the income gap between women and men has widened rather than narrowed, and masculine women of the 2000 cohort do not attain a higher proportion of the androgynous women's mean income compared to the 1990 cohort. Research limitations/implications – Career success is based on self-report data (income) and partially based on retrospective evaluations thereof. As the idea of connecting masculinity and femininity to gender and career outcomes arose after data collection, the authors had to rely on the psychometric items and scales already contained in the questionnaire. Originality/value – Instead of (re- or de-)constructing gender as bipolar object, but as realisation of historical acting including the context within which practical actions take place, the concept of GRT is applied to objective career success from a longitudinal perspective, owing to the relational nature of gender and the temporal nature of careers, as well as its embeddedness in the context within which trajectories unfold. In doing so, it shifts attention to career practices, emerging from the interplay of career field, career habitus, and career capital. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Careers; Equal opportunities; Income; Longitudinal study; Sex and gender issues",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Professional identity is defined by Ibarra and by Schein as one's professional self-concept based on attributes, beliefs, values, motives, and experiences. Professional identity construction under conditions of marginalization presents an interesting puzzle. Professional roles are defined as prestigious and provide the role holder with autonomy and, often, a degree of privilege. However, minority professionals are often accorded little prestige and/or privilege because their identities are perceived as inferior. Design/methodology/approach – The research studies narratives by 33 prominent women engineers with careers in management who discuss what it means to be both women and engineers holding high management positions in their organizations. Findings – The research demonstrates that the process of identity construction for women engineers differs in significant ways from that of their male counterparts. The process is centered in redefinition that allows women professionals to construct possible selves and establish positive professional identities: redefinition of occupational rhetorics, disadvantage, and the self. Research limitations/implications – This study of professional identity construction under conditions of disadvantaged gender identity contributes a new perspective for theorists researching professional identity construction. The results reveal that the development of professional identity for minority women may involve the processes and tasks of redefinition. The tasks in redefinition include redefining disadvantage, redefining the profession, and redefining the self. Moreover, the use of narrative calls for organizational researchers to consider theories in sociology, history, policy, and psychology in the attempts to answer careers questions. Practical implications – The implications of this research are significant for human resource management practices in the construction and engineering field. Originality/value – While there is growing interest in professional identity construction (e.g. Clarke et al.), little is known about how marginalization may influence the development of professional identity of minority professionals, such as women managers in engineering. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Careers; Engineering; Professional identity; Role ambiguity; Sex and gender issues; Women",,"Kyriakidou, O.; Department of Business Administration, University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach – The quantitative data at senior management level draw on a largely web-based study, supplemented by interview data from a purposive sample of 40 people (85 per cent response rate) in senior management positions in all seven universities funded by the state – including those at Dean to Presidential level, men and women, and academics and non-academics. The interview schedule used in the qualitative study was devised by the eight-country Women in Higher Education Management Network (WHEM). Findings – Irish universities are very male-dominated at senior management, professoriate and governance levels. The qualitative data suggest that the limits to change are an organisational culture that is homosocial and conformist, where women and their attitudes and priorities are seen as “the problem”. Yet there was a striking level of endorsement of various discourses suggesting that having women in senior management makes a difference. Research limitations/implications – The failure of the Higher Educational Authority to collect data on the gender of those in senior management in Irish universities has necessitated the use of the web. This is an effective pragmatic response, but obviously not as satisfactory as official data. Practical implications – It has been widely recognised that diversity in management teams is positively associated with innovation. In this context the absence of such diversity in the senior management teams in Irish universities raises concerns in the context of the challenges facing Irish society in general and the university sector in particular. The references to the organisational culture as conformist and homosocial raise fundamental questions about the universities' ability to use the skills of their staff to move the institution forward. Originality/value – The paper is the first specific study of senior management in Irish universities. It echoes and specifies the nature of the organisational culture – but also highlights the existence of legitimating discourses endorsed by senior managers. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Change; Change management; Diversification; Gender; Ireland; Irish; Management culture; Universities; Women",,"O'Connor, P.; Department of Sociology, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 120 senior government leaders evaluated simulated performance reviews wherein only manager's sex and engagement in individually considerate transformational leadership behavior varied. Findings – Senior leaders (of both sexes) penalized male and female managers for failing to engage in individually considerate transformational leadership behavior (i.e. rating them as significantly less competent and civil, and recommending them for significantly fewer rewards such as salary and promotion) compared to control groups. However, only male managers benefited (in terms of competence ratings, recognition and reward) from being rated high on this behavior. Practical implications – Findings support arguments in the literature for a “feminization” of leadership, whereby both male and female managers are now penalized for not engaging in individually considerate leadership behavior. However, they also question the extent to which women will get credit for engaging in some of the same transformational leadership behaviors as men. Originality/value – Researchers and practitioners often collapse across components of the Multi-Factor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) in measuring transformational leadership behavior. This may obfuscate some of the components being aligned with sex role stereotypes, and therefore unlikely to be rewarded in certain candidates. If the present findings are confirmed by future research, there may be reason to question how the MLQ is being used in research and practice on transformational leadership behavior. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Individually considerate leadership behaviour; Leader evaluation; Leadership; Leadership styles; Performance appraisal; Promotion; Transformational leadership; Women",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Using a post-structuralist framework, it seeks to deconstruct the representations of managers in several popular films. It aims to propose that the analysis of this representation allows complex questions about the nature of power in organizations and the “opportunity costs” of resistance to be addressed. Design/methodology/approach – This article focuses on the discursive formation of managers and employees in popular films. The films were chosen using a popularity measure on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com) and treated as “visual narratives”. A variation of Rose's discourse analysis method was used. To critically view the films, a post-structuralist perspective was adopted, in which questions of power, gender and sexuality are seen as fundamental. Gender is a discursive practice that becomes material through the power and resistance subjectified by the human body while “truth” is referenced through specific words and images – so constructed by the “reality” of popular culture. Findings – The analysis reveals two seemingly competing discourses surrounding the representations of managers that encompass both a description of power and the resistance to this power. In this sense, although popular films position subjects – managers and those managed – in very specific ways, at the same time their construct of power is highly contextual and open to change. This finding leads to, first, a Foucauldian understanding of power and, second, a reconceptualization of power and resistance as one and the same construct, power/resistance, that may help address the “where”, “who”, and “why” of resistance that has previously been ignored. Originality/value – The article brings popular culture to center stage in organization studies and argues that by not paying attention to its power to inform, society is cut off from valuable knowledge about how management is “done”. The article also reveals that although on surface the representations of managers in films seem to reinforce the dominant discourse of the “macho” manager, at the same time, a second representation – the bright, eager, usually working-class employee who wants to emulate the boss but then “sees the light” and becomes a “hero” – is offering a critique of this construct, making popular culture potentially subversive. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cinema; Gender; Organizations; Postmodernism; Qualitative research; Sex and gender issues",,"Panayiotou, A.; Department of Public and Business Administration, University of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach – The special issue arose following the success of a stream on gender, management and leadership held at the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Conference, and generated 22 full-paper submissions for consideration from conference participants and from responses to the call. The papers covered many themes and incorporated a range of different methodologies. Ultimately, six were selected to be included in this special issue. Findings – All studies of this special isue reveal gender performativity, as the “taken for granted” practice of gender. They show, exactly as suggested by Butler, that gender categories are brought into being performatively, so that “naming” of a subject creates the preconditions for certain categories which then become invested with meaning. Practical implications – All of the studies included in this special issue show that studying gender, management and leadership in organisations is significant: we do not really leave gender at the door when entering our organisational work lives; rather, we “do” gender in specific ways, some reflexive but most perhaps not. Originality/value – The paper shows that the special issue highlights the fact that management jobs have traditionally been understood as being constructed according to male norms and thus creating difficulties for women. These include the material part of their work as well as the stereotypical expectations and perceptions and reactions from others. The taken-for-granted point of departure is that women and men are essentially different, as shown by the ascribed congruency between men and management jobs. The studies reported in this special issue, however, try to challenge such conceptions and call for more sophisticated ways to interpret women's and men's experiences in management positions to enhance the understanding of the complexity of everyday organisational processes. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Gender; Leadership; Managers",,"Kyriakidou, O.; Department of Business Administration, University of Economics and Business, Athens, Greece",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

This study examines how one strategy-single-sex secondary education-correlates with mathematical and computer self-concept among women entering college. The study uses multilevel modeling to address secondary school-level effects in a national sample of college-going women. The analyses suggest that allgirls secondary schools-whether independent or Catholic-affiliated-produce graduates who enter college marginally more confident in their mathematical and computer skills than women from equivalent backgrounds who attend coeducational schools. For the most part, the small predictive power of school gender remains significant even after accounting for the confounding role of student background characteristics, school-level features, and peer contexts within each school.

The purpose of the paper is to assess the effectiveness of the ADVANCE grant initiative. Effectiveness is measured by the changes in institutional climate in terms of attitudes toward gender diversity and increase in representation and advancement of female faculty in science and engineering. The climate surveys administered at the beginning and at the end of the ADVANCE initiative targeted all male and female tenure-track and tenured faculty in 18 science and engineering departments. The results showed that the gender-based differences in the assessment of institutional climate observed at the beginning of the initiative lessened or became insignificant at the end of the initiative.

Black feminist thought inquiry was used as the theoretical framework and a grounded-theory approach was used to analyze the data. Through these women's experiences, informal and formal avenues of exposure such as family influence, informal dialogue, and attending historically black colleges and universities emerged as factors for their success in becoming a mathematician.

Although many programs exist for high school students, girls may lose interest in STEM subjects at an earlier age. Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science (FEMMES) hosts an annual, free, one-day event that provides exciting, hands-on workshops for 4th-6th grade girls from Durham, North Carolina, to encourage them to further explore their potential in these fields.

As early as middle school, girls begin to lose interest in science and math, reducing the likelihood of ever pursuing a career path in STEM fields. To address this problem, we developed an after-school outreach curriculum as part of the Females Excelling More in Math, Engineering, and Science (FEMMES) program at Duke University [see companion paper in this issue (Shuen et al., J. Women Minor. Sci. Eng., vol. 17, no. 4, p. 295-313, 2011)]. The goal of the FEMMES after-school program is to inspire 4th-6th grade girls in science, math, and engineering through hands-on activities with female undergraduate and graduate student volunteers. We examined the interest, knowledge, and confidence in STEM fields measured through pre- and post-test surveys given to 100 girls who participated in the FEMMES after-school program. A mixed ANOVA (analysis of variance between groups) revealed a significant increase in the girls' interest in science and engineering, knowledge in science, and confidence in math and science. Students (almost unanimously) gave high ratings to the seven STEM activities included in the after-school program. Although the study was small, the results are encouraging and we continue to assess the impact of this engaging program. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.","Confidence; Education; Elementary school; Gender disparity; Interest; Knowledge; Middle school; Outreach; Role models; Underprivileged",,"Chen, C. -F.

When personal, educational, and employment characteristics are controlled for, ordinary least-squares and quantile regressions at the 10th, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles show that being Asian did not have a disadvantage in 1993 or 2003. The second factor, Asian nativity, had a negative effect at one percentile in each year. The most striking finding is that having the highest degree from an Asian institution, compared with that received in the United States, led to earning disadvantages at all percentiles in 1993 (from 8.7% to 22.6%) and in 2003 (from 6.1% to 11.7%). The degree origin effect can be explained by queuing and devaluation theories but better by the region-specific human capital (and social capital) theory. The decline of the degree origin effect over time can be explained by changes in institutional factors, including improvements in Asian education, closer US -Asian connections, and changes in human resource needs for the science and engineering workforce in the United States. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.","Asian education; Asians; Devaluation theory; Engineers; Quantile regression; Queuing theory; Region-specific human capital",,"Tao, Y.; College of Arts and Letters, Stevens Institute of Technology, 1 Castle Point on Hudson, Hoboken, NJ 07030, United States; email: yu.tao@stevens.edu",,,10728325,,,,"English","J.

The overall findings of this study suggest that faculty play an important role in encouraging or dissuading the African American engineers in this study to persist in their respective majors. Additionally, the involvement in faculty research laboratories and the referral by faculty to other opportunities and internships relevant to careers in engineering gave participants a much-needed practical application of their coursework. However, faculty can also have an equally paralyzing impact on students' academic and subsequent career goals through a hierarchical authoritarian disposition. The African American engineers in this study cited examples of both faculty members who were inspiring and those who were barriers to participants' academic and career goals.

Sense of belonging is a critical factor in the adjustment and persistence of students of color in predominantly white institutions and is strongly connected to a student's campus racial diversity experiences. Many institutions have created living-learning programs to increase women's retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. However, little is known about whether these programs facilitate important outcomes for women of color, such as their sense of belonging and campus racial diversity experiences. Using a conceptual framework of learning community practice that identifies inclusion of diversity issues as core principles of practice (Lardner, 2005), this study examined STEM living-learning program participation, overall sense of belonging, interactions with diverse peers, and perceptions of the campus racial climate among racially/ ethnically diverse women in STEM majors. Women of color reported lower participation rates in STEM living-learning programs, less strong overall sense of belonging, and more frequent interactions with racially/ethnically diverse peers than did white/Caucasian women. Black/African American women reported less positive perceptions of the campus racial climate than did women from the other racial/ethnic groups. Findings suggest that achieving a sense of belonging to their campus and having positive campus racial climate perceptions are important for women of color in STEM majors that can be facilitated, in part, by STEM living-learning programs. To engage in effective learning community practice, STEM living-learning program educators should consider the needs of racially/ethnically diverse students. © 2011 by Begell House, Inc.","Learning communities; Minority women; Racial climate; Retention programs",,"Johnson, D.

The study uses an integrated, or ""horizontal,"" method of reading, which regards journal issues as collectively authored texts and emphasizes the spatial relation and interplay of printed content. Writings and images are referred to as integral aspects of representation to illustrate the ways in which heteronormativity is covertly challenged at the same time that same-sex love and the rejection of marriage are forcefully stigmatized. A special focus of the analysis is an examination of how the valorization of heterosexual love is matched by vociferous attacks on men and idealizations of female bonds, which are at times valued over relations with men. Insinuations of alternative sensibilities and desires are also highlighted, especially the magazine's celebration of masculine women in images. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","female same-sex love; Heteronormativity; horizontal reading; print capitalism; Republican China",,"Wang, G.; University of British ColumbiaCanada; email: mail.gary.w@gmail.com",,,13876805,,,,"English","NAN NU",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855211136

For this reason, men found it useful to regulate the sexual practices of female kin to defend their own honor.

Taking lessons from the earlier pioneering efforts in museum practices, these black-centered sites are able to make significant contributions and frame the institution of slavery and the experience of enslavement within the tropes of survival, resistance, and achievement. Visual displays outlining slavery can be viewed as mechanisms by which cultural memory is induced as a tool for making meaning while collective identity in museums creates a space for investigating the relationship between the past and the present.

Lastly, our analysis found that consuming electronic religious programming did not substitute for attending church service but, instead, complemented weekly service attendance. © 2010 heheSpringer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Black church; Religious involvement; Religious radio; Religious television; West Indian",,"Taylor, R.

An unexpected finding of the research was that many of the women, unsolicited, expressed a belief in the importance of spirituality to their understanding and acceptance of what had happened to them during and after the foster care experience.

However, predictions are mixed when addressing the relationship between racial residential segregation and white crime. According to Massey (2001), whites should be expected to benefit from segregation. This paper explores the research and the literature related to racial residential segregation and crime from the perspective of white advantage. Specifically, it is postulated that racial residential segregation may benefit whites economically, politically, and culturally via several key pathways: by removing them from residential areas of concentrated disadvantage, by distancing them from criminogenic subcultures and areas of higher victimization, and by maintaining political stability and/or reinvestment in white neighborhoods. The methods by which these relationships may be empirically tested are discussed. We further explore different measures of racial segregation, as well as potential intervening variables that may mediate the relationship between racial residential segregation and crime, and discuss the benefits and implications for their inclusion in future research. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Crime; Disadvantage; Segregation; Victimization",,"Beaulieu, M.; Department of Sociology and Criminal Justice, SUNY Plattsburgh at Queensbury, Regional Higher Education Center, 640 Bay Road, Queensbury, NY 12804, United States; email: beaulieu.mark@gmail.com",,,15591646,,,,"English","J.

Common perceptions about Latin machismo and marianismo (the idea that women should be pure and moral) do not paint a portrait of gender egalitarian dispositions. These assessments are upheld by neomodernization theorists who specifically identify gender attitudes as a critical element of modernity. In applying a revised modernization theory to the issue of comparative gender values, Inglehart and Norris (2003, 10) hypothesize that development ""brings about changed cultural attitudes toward gender equality in virtually any society that experiences the various forms of modernization linked with economic development."" The idea that gender equality norms develop gradually, as a function of modernization, gives rise to different expectations about accepted gender roles in developing countries as opposed to those in advanced industrial democracies. Another feature of this modernization process is the emergence of gender gaps in political behavior and attitudes. Inglehart and Norris (2000) distinguish between traditional gender gaps found in postcommunist and developing societies (in which women are more conservative in their behavior and cultural attitudes relative to men) and modern gender gaps evident in postindustrial societies (in which women are more progressive than men). © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association, 2011.",,,"Bejarano, C.E.; Political Science at University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, United States; email: cbejaran@ku.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

In this article, we analyse the way population ageing is represented in three Swedish newspapers: Aftonbladet, Dagens Nyheter and Västerbottens-Kuriren. The aim is to investigate Swedish news-press representations of population ageing and the old age identities that they offer. We conduct qualitative analyses of the articulations between the verbal content and the use of illustrations, metaphorical language, headlines and captions using the concepts offered by discourse theory. The analysis of the material shows that the studied newspapers firmly position population ageing within a wider discourse of political economy and as a threat to the concept of welfare. Growth is promoted as a self-evident means for adjusting to the expected threat. Illustrations and metaphorical language helped to constitute population ageing as a serious, dichotomised (e.g. young vs. old) and emotive (e.g. addressing anxiety and fear) problem. The analyses also show how the representations of population ageing bear some populist features, and we argue that such features support a de-politicisation of the phenomenon population ageing. © The Authors.","Media; Old age; Population ageing; Populism",,"Lundgren, A.

The thinking encouraged by critical gerontology has been crucially important in provoking questions about the complexities of later life, age and ageing. Similarly, the interrogation of stories of age and ageing via narrative approaches and as found in literature are increasingly recognised as an important source of knowledge for mining the intricacies of later life. There are close links between the interests of critical gerontologists and those who engage in narrative and literary gerontology. However, the potential that critical gerontology has for illuminating and probing these stories of age has often been neglected. The central argument of this article is that narrative and literary approaches to age and ageing when allied to perspectives from critical gerontology can furnish scholars with important perspectives for interpreting and re-configuring ""age"". The focus is upon how a genuinely dialogic relationship between critical gerontology and narrative and literary gerontology can be forged.

The reinscription of women workers as a privileged category of social assistance over mothers at the core of the EU agenda led Polish policy-makers to develop policies promoting mothers rather than women workers as the socially worthy category of protection.

Although research indicates that men are more homophobic than women, examples are presented which examine some of the reasons why women use the word ""fag"" at work. Although equal opportunities at work have improved for sexual minorities over the past two decades, studies indicate that some forms of anti-lesbian, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) behaviour continue, which raises the question whether a hierarchy of inequality exists in some organizations.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on 22 in-depth key informant interviews which can be broken down as follows: diversity specialists (5), management (6, of whom 3 were sexual orientation senior management ""champions"" in their organisations), trade union (3) and LGBT network group representatives (8), as well as access to company and trade union web sites and publications. Interviews sought to trace the history of sexual orientation equality and diversity work, development of structures, policies and practices as well as triggers and barriers to progress and areas of innovation.

In the validation of their external identities, the author aims to identify critical incidents and experiences in gay men's working lives in which they have resisted or challenged identities, labels and stereotypes ascribed by others. Design/methodology/ approach: Data were gathered through ten semi-structured interviews with self-identified gay men in a wide range of occupations and age ranges working in Bournemouth, UK. Findings: The data focus on the fluidity of identity and the impact of organisational context. In their self-presentations a number of strategies were deployed. The respondents experienced exclusion, stereotyping, being viewed as a piece of curiosity, silence, discomfort and a marked identity in the eyes of others. In response to these reactions, themes of compliance, conformity and adopting an educator role were uncovered. Research limitations/implications: Although the findings presented are not necessarily generalizable, themes of exclusion, silence and marked identities were uncovered that echo many previous studies of gay men's experiences in the workplace. Originality/value: Little research has been done on identity management in the workplace beyond the issue of disclosure of sexual identity.

The insights of cognitive schemas on lesbian and gay identity are employed to link models of judicial decision making and gender/sexual orientation. Design/methodology/approach: Methodologically, the paper is located in the sociolegal tradition, but also uses case analysis to supplement and advance its thesis. Because US nondiscrimination law distinguishes between sexuality and gender discrimination, it provides a unique laboratory to critique not only American law, but the structure of nondiscrimination law generally. Findings: Judges' and others' schemas of lesbian and gay men suggest explanations for the analytical confusion in nondiscrimination law. Additionally, the paper's specific findings both supplement and question aspects of extant models of judicial decision making and gender/sexuality. Originality/value: Social cognition framework enables judges and commentators to reconceptualize facts and relevant doctrine in gender and sexual orientation discrimination cases and to critique some fundamental assumptions of nondiscrimination law. Further, because the paper bridges judicial decision making and gender/sexuality, researchers in those areas can use this analysis of a specific legal context to provide additional insights into how those models work and their underlying, hidden assumptions.

As family-owned businesses, ateliers draw on inexpensive and often unpaid, flexible, and loyal immediate and extended kin to provide labour. Garment ateliers operate informally on the outskirts of big cities, such as Istanbul, where rural migrant families comprise a cheap labour pool for enterprising migrant business owners. The role of women's unpaid and underpaid labour involvement in garment ateliers in Istanbul is a reflection of how these ateliers manage to integrate the social networks of extended kin relations into garment production.

This paper using data from the 2008 PSED investigates gender wage differentials among the disabled in Korea. The selectivity corrected decomposition framework is employed to examine what factors - endowments, discrimination, and selectivity - account for the wage gap. The main results presented in this paper are as follows: First, the gender wage gap among the disabled is sizable. Second, the wage gap is significantly attributable to discrimination. Moreover, disabled female workers also suffer a substantial wage penalty in terms of the portion of their wages attributable to discrimination. Third, the endowments factor plays an important role in explaining gender wage differentials as well. Finally, the presence of selection effects raises the observed wage gap. Such evidence suggests that Korean disabled female workers are more likely to be disadvantaged than their male counterparts in terms of wages. Thus, national policies, regulations or laws against gender discrimination (e.g., the U.K. DDA 1995, the U.S. ADA of 1990) and additional supports beyond prohibiting discrimination (e.g., vocational training, on-the-job training) are needed to enhance the labor market status of disabled female workers in Korea.","Disability; Discrimination; Gender; Korea; Wage differentials",,"Park, K.; University of ArizonaUnited States",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875898046

Eventually a sample of this subset (N = 285) also participated in individual in-depth interviews. Results illustrate differences between mothers in their 30s and 40s in the decision on managing dual pressures of childcare and limited income. Accordingly, younger mothers were fully concerned with childcare, as their children were younger. As such, they put the idea of employment aside even though they faced financial hardship. In contrast, the older mothers suffered more from work-family conflict, as they more likely engaged in employment. Easing younger mothers' childcare and older mothers' work-family interplay is therefore a reasonable concern for public support for the mothers.","China; Hong Kong; Life-course; Low-income community; Mothers; Work-family balance",,"Ho, W.-C.; City University of Hong KongHong Kong; email: wingcho@cityu.edu.hk",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875916036

On the one hand, the two heroines in the play are the victims of homophobia due to the tragic violence that befalls them. On the other hand, the tender, innocent and genuine kiss between them, which is delayed to the last scene, represents their courage in facing their difference in the public and rebelling against the old views of a hetero-patriarchal world in which a woman identifies her role in relation to the man that she serves. Regardless of the man-specified responsibilities of staying at home, bearing babies and serving their husbands, the heroines gradually transform their identities from being heterosexuals to the ambiguous lesbians. Instead of focusing on the sex/gender binary in heterosexual dualism, the author reassesses the identities of the heroines based on diversity and plurality. Furthermore, Diana Son apparently sees no value in emphasizing her ethnicity as an Asian American writer, as the label of ethnicity narrows the potential world views of both the writer and the audience. Accordingly, the ""kiss"" in the play comes as a cataclysmic leap of self-awareness, trust and commitment, not solely as a statement of race and sexuality. It not only exposes the violence, bias and inequality of society, but also surpasses the writer's self-identity as a heterosexual Asian American woman and rewrites her identity within the fulfillment of humanity without superiorities of race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality.","Diana son; Rewrite; Self-identity; Stop kiss",,"Jiang, M.; Shanghai International Studies UniversityChina",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875891290

Drawing on Adriana Cavarero's Arendtian definition of the political, this article argues that feminist political subjectivity is shaped relationally through mutual self-exposure in the public sphere. In this way, exposure to others becomes a constitutive act contributing to an ongoing version of subjectivity.

The main aim is to explore how gender intersects with student identity(ies) in a specific local context. The article draws upon qualitative data from doctoral research that explored the crime and fear experiences of women students studying in a town bearing all the hallmarks of industrial decline. It evidences powerful representations of place with respondents drawing heavily on the town's working-class culture and de-industrialisation in their reading of the locale. In addition, respondents linked the town unequivocally to crime and disorder, and identified the criminal threat as originating from local people. In this way, fears were frequently locally focused, linking to a fear of place and the risks associated with student identity. This highlights that women's fears and spatial negotiation cannot be read exclusively in terms of gender - in this context they are frequently shaped by 'studenthood' and the dynamics of class and locality.

Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that increased exposure to female sex hormones is associated with a lower risk of CRC in women, and cyclin D1, an important downstream effector in estrogen-mediated signaling, is commonly activated in CRC. In this study, we analyzed the prognostic significance of cyclin D1 expression in CRC, with particular reference to sex-related differences, in tumors from a large, prospective, population-based cohort. Methods: Using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry, the fraction and intensity of cyclin D1 expression was evaluated in 527 incident CRC cases from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. The χ2 and Spearman's rho (r) tests were used for comparison of cyclin D1 expression and relevant clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to assess the effect of cyclin D1 expression on cancer-specific survival (CSS) in univariate and multivariate analysis, adjusted for established prognostic factors. Results: Cyclin D1 intensity was significantly lower in male compared with female CRC (P = 0.018). In the full cohort, cyclin D1 expression was associated with a significantly prolonged CSS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.69; 95% CI 0.49 to 0.96, P = 0.026) but subgroup analysis according to gender revealed a strongly accentuated prognostic effect of cyclin D1 in male CRC (HR = 0.48; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.74, P &lt; 0.001), which was in contrast to female CRC, where cyclin D1 was not prognostic (HR = 1.05; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.78, P = 0.864) (Pinteraction = 0.024). The prognostic value of cyclin D1 was not retained in multivariate analysis, either in the full cohort or in male CRC. Conclusions: Cyclin D1 expression is strongly associated with prolonged survival in male CRC. These findings not only support an important role for cyclin D1 in colorectal carcinogenesis, but also add further weight to the accumulating evidence that CRC is indeed a hormone-dependent malignancy, for which prognostic and treatmentpredictive molecular biomarkers should be evaluated differently in women and men. © 2011 Wangefjord et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Wangefjord, S.; Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Skåne University Hospital, 221 85 Lund, Sweden; email: sakarias.wangefjord@med.lu.se",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

However, less than 50% of the scientific studies published in 2009 using experimental animals reported sex as a biological variable. Because every cell has a sex, we conducted a literature review to determine the extent to which sex is reported as a variable in cardiovascular studies on cultured cells. Methods: Articles from 10 cardiovascular journals with high impact factors (Circulation, J Am Coll Cardiol, Eur Heart J, Circ Res, Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, Cardiovasc Res, J Mol Cell Cardiol, Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, J Heart Lung Transplant and J Cardiovasc Pharmacol) and published in 2010 were searched using terms 'cultured' and 'cells' in any order to determine if the sex of those cells was reported. Studies using established cell lines were excluded. Results: Using two separate search strategies, we found that only 25 of 90 articles (28%) and 20 of 101 articles (19.8%) reported the sex of cells. Of those reporting the sex of cells, most (68.9%; n = 31) used only male cells and none used exclusively female cells. In studies reporting the sex of cells of cardiovascular origin, 40% used vascular smooth-muscle cells, and 30% used stem/progenitor cells. In studies using cells of human origin, 35% did not report the sex of those cells. None of the studies using neonatal cardiac myocytes reported the sex of those cells. Conclusions: The complement of sex chromosomes in cells studied in culture has the potential to affect expression of proteins and 'mechanistic' signaling pathways. Therefore, consistent with scientific excellence, editorial policies should require reporting sex of cells used in in vitro experiments. © 2011 Taylor et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Miller, V.M.; Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st St SW, Rochester, MN 55905, United States; email: miller.virginia@mayo.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Aerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to prevent and treat HTN; however, resistance exercise (RE) is not recommended as a strategy to treat HTN. In this study, we investigated the potential sex differences of AE versus RE in a cohort of unmedicated patients with hypertension. Methods: In total, 40 moderately active, pre-hypertensive or stage 1 essential hypertensive male (M) and female (F) participants aged 40 to 60 years were randomly divided into four groups: M AE, M RE, F AE, and F. Each group exercised at moderate intensity, 3 days/week for 4 weeks. Hemodynamic, vascular and blood-flow data were collected before and after exercise training. Results: Men showed a significant increase in central pulse wave velocity following RE while females showed no significant changes (12 ± to 13.9 ± vs. 9.2 ± to 9.6 ± m/s, respectively). RE showed significantly greater increases in peak blood flow when compared to AE (F RE 15 ± to 20 ± vs. F AE 17.5 ± to19.5 ±, M RE 19 ± to 24 ± vs M AE 21 ± to 25 ± ml* 100 ml*min, respectively). In addition, systolic and diastolic BP decreased greater for women following RE when compared to AE whereas men showed comparable decreases in BP following either exercise mode. Conclusion: Moderate-intensity RE training may be a more favorable for women as a treatment option for hypertension because of greater decreases in diastolic BP and significant increases in flow-mediated dilation without concomitant increases in arterial stiffness, compared with their male counterparts. © 2011 Collier et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Collier, S.R.; Vascular Biology and Autonomic Studies Laboratory, Appalachian State University, 111 Rivers Street, Boone, NC 28608, United States; email: colliersr@appstate.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

This sexual dimorphism has been thought to be due to increased mRNA synthesis stimulated by androgen. However, the klk1b26 protein level in female SMG is far less than that expected from the mRNA level, suggesting an additional mechanism for down-regulation of klk1b26 expression in female SMGs. Methods: We examined the effects of small non-coding RNAs in mouse SMGs on in vitro translation of klk1b26 using a reticulocyte lysate system and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for klk1b26 mRNA. Statistical analyses were performed with a computer package (Microsoft Excel). Results: The microRNA (miRNA) preparation from female SMGs, but not male SMGs, interfered with the in vitro translation of the klk1b26 protein and inhibited the RT-PCR for klk1b26 mRNA with forward primers targeting its 5′- terminal region (between the 15th and 40th nucleotide from the 5′-terminal). The miRNA preparation from castrated mouse SMGs showed the inhibitory effect on the klk1b26 translation, but that from a 5α-dihydrotestosterone-treated female mouse SMGs did not. Synthetic miRNAs (miR-325 and miR-1497a), which have partial complementarity with klk1b26 mRNA at its 5′-terminal region (15th to 40th nucleotide position from the 5′- terminal), also interfered with the in vitro klk1b26 translation. When the female miRNA preparation was incubated with a 30-nucleotide-long single-strand oligoDNA (named [15th-44th]ssDNA, whose sequence corresponded to the 15th to 44th position from the 5′-terminal of klk1b26 mRNA) prior to the addition into the in vitro translation system, the inhibitory effect of the miRNA preparation on klk1b26 translation disappeared, while [15th-44th]ssDNA itself had no effect on the translation. Preincubation of the miRNA preparation with another single-strand DNA ([169th-198th]ssDNA, whose sequence corresponded with 169th to 198th position of klk1b26 mRNA) did not show the inhibitory effect. Conclusions: The small non-coding RNA, most probably miRNA, specifically expressed in female mouse SMGs interfered with klk1b26 protein synthesis in the in vitro translation system. Therefore sexual dimorphism observed in klk1b26 expression in mouse SMGs is due at least in part to the female-specific small non-coding RNA in SMGs. © 2011 Kurihara et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Kallikrein; Klk1b26; MicroRNA; Salivary gland; Sex difference; Testosterone; Translation",,"Kurihara, K.; Department of Physiology, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan; email: kkinji@dent.meikai.ac.jp",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

This differs from common or 'dietary' obesity, i.e., obesity apparently due to environmentally stimulated overeating, in which IAAT and subcutaneous (S) AT increase in similar proportions. The effect of menopause on adiposity is thought to be due to the decreased secretion of ovarian estrogens. Ovariectomy in rats and other animals is a commonly used model of menopause. It is well known that ovariectomy increases adiposity and that this can be reversed by estradiol treatment, but whether ovariectomy selectively increases IAAT has not been measured directly. Therefore, we used micro-computed tomography (microCT) to investigate this question in both chow-fed and dietary-obese rats. Methods: Ovariectomized, ovariectomized and estradiol treated, and sham-operated (intact) rats were fed chow or chow plus Ensure (Abbott Nutrition; n = 7/group). Total (T) AT, IAAT and SAT were measured periodically by microCT. Regional distribution of AT was expressed as IAAT as a percentage of TAT (%IAAT). Excesses in these measures were calculated with respect to chow-fed intact rats to control for normal maturational changes. Chemical analysis of fat was done in chow-fed intact and ovariectomized rats at study end. Data were analyzed by t-tests and planned comparisons. Results: Body mass, TAT, total fat mass, fat-free body mass, and %IAAT all increased in chow-fed intact rats during the 41 d study. In chow-fed rats, ovariectomy increased excess body mass, TAT, fat mass, fat-free body mass, and SAT, but had little effect on IAAT, in chow-fed rats, leading to a decrease in %IAAT. Ensure feeding markedly increased SAT, IAAT and TAT and did not significantly affect %IAAT. Ovariectomy had similar effects in Ensure-fed rats as in chow-fed rats, although less statistically reliable. Estradiol treatment prevented all the effects of ovariectomy. Conclusions: Both ovariectomy in rats and menopause are associated with increased TAT. After ovariectomy, fat is preferentially deposited as SAT and lean body mass increases, whereas after menopause fat is preferentially deposited as IAAT and lean body mass decreases. These opposite effects of ovariectomy and menopause on regional AT distribution and lean body mass indicate that ovariectomy in rats is not a homologous model of menopause-associated changes in body composition that should be used with great caution in investigations of adiposity-related diseases. © 2011 Gloy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Asarian, L.; Institute of Veterinary Physiology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of ZurichSwitzerland; email: lasarian@vetphys.uzh.ch",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

We previously showed that macrophages in the spleen are phenotypically distinct in male compared to female mice at 12 h after infection. This innate immune profile mirrors and predicts the cardiac immune response during acute myocarditis. Methods: In order to study sex differences in the innate immune response, five male and female BALB/c mice were infected intraperitoneally with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) or phosphate buffered saline and their spleens were harvested 12 h later for microarray analysis. Gene expression was determined using an Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST Array. Significant gene changes were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or ELISA. Results: During the innate immune response to CVB3 infection, infected males had higher splenic expression of genes which are important in regulating the influx of cholesterol into macrophages, such as phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the macrophage scavenger receptor compared to the infected females. We also observed a higher expression in infected males compared to infected females of squalene synthase, an enzyme used to generate cholesterol within cells, and Cyp2e1, an enzyme important in metabolizing cholesterol and steroids. Infected males also had decreased levels of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which binds PLA2 and is the rate-limiting step for steroidogenesis, as well as decreased expression of the androgen receptor (AR), which indicates receptor activation. Gene differences were not due to increased viral replication, which was unaltered between sexes. Conclusions: We found that, compared to females, male mice had a greater splenic expression of genes which are important for cholesterol metabolism and activation of the AR at 12 h after infection. Activation of the AR has been linked to increased cardiac hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, myocarditis/DCM and heart failure in male mice and humans. © 2011 Onyimba et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Fairweather, D.; Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States; email: dfairwea@jhsph.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Previous research in male and female rats selectively bred for high or low locomotor reactivity to novelty found that bred High Responders (bHRs) acquire cocaine self-administration more rapidly than bred Low Responders (bLRs) and that bHR females in particular self-administered more cocaine than the other groups. The experiments presented here aimed to determine whether an individual's sex and behavioral phenotype interact to affect motivation to take cocaine. Methods: We examined motivation for taking cocaine in two experiments using a range of doses on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of responding in bHR or bLR males and females. Additionally, we included a measure of continuing to respond in the absence of reinforcement, a feature of addiction that has been recently incorporated into tests of animal models on the basis of the criteria for substance use disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 software. Data were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni correction post hoc test when applicable. Results: We found sex differences as well as effects of novelty reactivity on the motivation to self-administer cocaine. Specifically, females demonstrated higher breaking points on the PR schedule compared with males, regardless of phenotype, and bHR males and females exhibited higher motivation than bLR animals at a number of the doses studied.

Gonadal steroids can modulate sex differences in response to both viruses. Here, the effect of sex chromosomal complement in response to viral infection was evaluated using four core genotypes (FCG) mice, where the Sry gene is deleted from the Y chromosome, and in some mice is inserted into an autosomal chromosome. This results in four genotypes: XX or XY gonadal females (XXF and XYF), and XX or XY gonadal males (XXM and XYM). The FCG model permits evaluation of the impact of the sex chromosome complement independent of the gonadal phenotype. Methods: Wild-type (WT) male and female C57BL/6 mice were assigned to remain intact or be gonadectomized (Gdx) and all FCG mice on a C57BL/6 background were Gdx. Mice were infected with either CVB3 or mouseadapted IAV, A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), and monitored for changes in immunity, virus titers, morbidity, or mortality. Results: In CVB3 infection, mortality was increased in WT males compared to females and males developed more severe cardiac inflammation. Gonadectomy suppressed male, but increased female, susceptibility to CVB3. Infection with IAV resulted in greater morbidity and mortality in WT females compared with males and this sex difference was significantly reduced by gonadectomy of male and female mice. In Gdx FCG mice infected with CVB3, XY mice were less susceptible than XX mice. Protection correlated with increased CD4+ forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)+ T regulatory (Treg) cell activation in these animals. Neither CD4+ interferon (IFN)γ (T helper 1 (Th1)) nor CD4+ interleukin (IL)-4+ (Th2) responses differed among the FCG mice during CVB3 infection. Infection of Gdx FCG mice revealed no effect of sex chromosome complement on morbidity or mortality following IAV infection. Conclusions: These studies indicate that sex chromosome complement can influence pathogenicity of some, but not all, viruses. © 2011 Robinson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Robinson, D.P.; W Harry Feinstone Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205, United States; email: dirobinso@jhsph.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Astrocytes, one of the glial cell types of the brain, show sex differences in number, differentiation and function. Since astrocytes are involved in the response of neural tissue to injury and inflammation, these cells may participate in the generation of sex differences in the response of the brain to pathological insults. To explore this hypothesis, we have examined whether male and female astrocytes show a different response to an inflammatory challenge and whether perinatal testosterone influences this response. Methods: Cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared from postnatal day 1 (one day after birth) male or female CD1 mice pups. In addition, cortical astrocyte cultures were also prepared from female pups that were injected at birth with 100 μg of testosterone propionate or vehicle. Cultures were treated for 5 hours with medium containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or with control medium. The mRNA levels of IL6, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP10), TNFα, IL1β, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and translocator protein were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired t-test or by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post hoc test. Results: The mRNA levels of IL6, TNFα and IL1β after LPS treatment were significantly higher in astrocytes derived from male or androgenized females compared to astrocytes derived from control or vehicle-injected females. In contrast, IP10 mRNA levels after LPS treatment were higher in astrocytes derived from control or vehicle-injected females than in those obtained from males or androgenized females. The different response of male and female astrocytes to LPS was due neither to differences in the basal expression of the inflammatory molecules nor to differences in the expression of the LPS receptor TLR4. In contrast, the different inflammatory response was associated with increased mRNA levels of translocator protein, a key steroidogenic regulator, in female astrocytes that were treated with LPS. Conclusions: Male and female cortical astrocytes respond differentially to an inflammatory challenge and this may be predetermined by perinatal testosterone exposure. © 2011 Santos-Galindo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","IFN-inducible protein 10; IL1β; IL6; Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; Testosterone; TNFα; Toll-like receptor 4; Translocator protein 18 kDa",,"Garcia-Segura, L.M.; Instituto Cajal, CSIC, Avenida Doctor Arce 37, E-28002 Madrid, Spain; email: lmgs@cajal.csic.es",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

A report of prenatal growth retardation in cases of 46, XY DSD, coupled with observations of below-optimal final height in both males and females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, prompted us to investigate prenatal growth in the latter group. Additionally, because girls with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are exposed to increased levels of androgens in the absence of a male sex-chromosome complement, the presence or absence of typical sex differences in growth of newborns would support or refute a hormonal explanation for these differences. Methods: In total, 105 newborns with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were identified in our database. Gestational age (weeks), birth weight (kg), birth length (cm) and parental heights (cm) were obtained. Mid-parental height was considered in the analyses. Results: Mean birth weight percentile for congenital adrenal hyperplasia was 49.26%, indicating no evidence of a difference in birth weight from the expected standard population median of 50th percentile (P > 0.05). The expected sex difference in favor of heavier males was not seen (P > 0.05). Of the 105 subjects, 44 (27%; 34 females, 10 males) had birth length and gestational age recorded in their medical chart. Mean birth length for this subgroup was 50.90 cm (63rd percentile), which differed from the expected standard population median of 50th percentile (P = 0.0082). The expected sex difference in favor of longer males was also not seen (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The prenatal growth retardation patterns reported in cases of 46,XY disorders of sex development do not generalize to people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Sex differences in body weight and length typically seen in young infants were not seen in the subjects who participated in this study. We speculate that these differences were ameliorated in this study because of increased levels of prenatal androgens experienced by the females infants. © 2011 Chalmers et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Chalmers, L.J.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma College of Medicine-Tulsa, Tulsa, OK 74135, United States; email: laura-chalmers@ouhsc.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Women generally report higher pain intensity at rest and greater perceived functional deficits than men. Women also perform worse than men on function measures such as the 6-minute walk and timed up and go tests. Differences in pain sensitivity, pain during function, psychosocial variables, and physical activity levels are unclear. Further the ability of various biopsychosocial variables to explain physical activity, function and pain is unknown. Methods: This study examined differences in pain, pain sensitivity, function, psychosocial variables, and physical activity between women and men with knee osteoarthritis (N = 208) immediately prior to total knee arthroplasty. We assessed: (1) pain using self-report measures and a numerical rating scale at rest and during functional tasks, (2) pain sensitivity using quantitative sensory measures, (3) function with self-report measures and specific function tasks (timed walk, maximal active flexion and extension), (4) psychosocial measures (depression, anxiety, catastrophizing, and social support), and (5) physical activity using accelerometry. The ability of these mixed variables to explain physical activity, function and pain was assessed using regression analysis. Results: Our findings showed significant differences on pain intensity, pain sensitivity, and function tasks, but not on psychosocial measures or physical activity. Women had significantly worse pain and more impaired function than men. Their levels of depression, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, social support, and physical activity, however, did not differ significantly. Factors explaining differences in (1) pain during movement (during gait speed test) were pain at rest, knee extension, state anxiety, and pressure pain threshold; (2) function (gait speed test) were sex, age, knee extension, knee flexion opioid medications, pain duration, pain catastrophizing, body mass index (BMI), and heat pain threshold; and (3) physical activity (average metabolic equivalent tasks (METS)/day) were BMI, age, Short-Form 36 (SF-36) Physical Function, Kellgren-Lawrence osteoarthritis grade, depression, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) pain subscale. Conclusions: Women continue to be as physically active as men prior to total knee replacement even though they have significantly more pain, greater pain sensitivity, poorer perceived function, and more impairment on specific functional tasks. © 2011 Tonelli et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Rakel, B.A.; College of Nursing, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States; email: barbara-rakel@uiowa.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Most of the time, the dowry that was bestowed upon daughters at the time of their marriage was the only portion of their father's inheritance that they received. Sumptuary legislation tried to limit the dowries, especially between patrician families, but was much less strict when the marriage was between a populares bride and a patrician groom. In fact, we can consider that the aim of the legislation concerning dowries was to maintain a balance between the patrician families that governed the Republic of Venice, and that it played an important role in protecting the stability of the State. During the marriage, the dowry was still the property of the bride, but the husband had total control over it. However, he had to guarantee its restitution to his widow or to her family, with his immovable goods as a security.

It served as a guarantee of the subsistence level of women in the first few months after the dissolution of the marriage, because they were not legal heirs either as widows or as daughters. In the Middle Ages, the role of the ketubah changed fundamentally. The altered economic conditions made it necessary to retain the family fortune undivided in one place for as long as possible in order for it to be used effectively.

When migrants send social remittances, or ideas, practices, and know-how, back to their homelands, they challenge conventional ideas about marriage, child-rearing, and women's work. The impact of global ideas about women's rights, and how they are vernacularized or made understandable and useful in local contexts, very much depends on the historical, cultural, and organizational contexts through which they travel.Implications - The chapter has both practical and social implications showing how using a transnational optic elucidates aspects of contemporary social experience that are obscured when we assume that the nation-state is the logical automatic container within which social life takes place.",,,"Levitt, P.",,,15292126,,,,"English","Adv.

New norms and new roles were taken up in the migrant camps, but village life with its traditional extended family structure was still considered ideal for the social security it provided. However, aged widows are no longer treated with respect and care, suggesting a decline in the traditional joint family system and of the dominant position of elderly widowed women in it.

First, it explores mechanisms influencing the unequal distribution of financial and care support within Ukrainian transnational families.

First, marital status regulates quantities of migrant women's support, which encourages the self-exploitation of married migrant women, in contrast to single mothers. Second, the quantities of migrant men's social support are influenced by their educational achievements in Germany.

They are divided by national allegiances, social class statuses, and racial ethnic identities as well as by gender. Individuals have more than one status, and these statuses intersect and impact on each other. When some or all of these statuses are in disadvantaged groups, the result of this intersectionality of disadvantaged statuses is complex inequality. Feminist scholarship has to be able to work with multiple categories and multiple identities in examining the causes of and remedies for complex inequality.The concept of gender in intersectional research alludes to a social status equivalent to other advantaged and disadvantaged social statuses. I contrast the premises of gender feminism and woman's feminism to show the development of the concept of gender as social structural, rather than just individual, interactive, and relational.Findings - Useful strategies in the new directions in feminist research that are intersectional and global are the following: using more than one set of opposites, recognizing subjects' multiple identities and status dilemmas, analyzing the effects of intersectionality on complex inequality, and being aware of the advantages and disadvantages of the researcher's standpoint.Value - The value of these strategies of multidimensional feminist research is to develop new sources of knowledge and new approaches for effective transnational feminist political activism.",,,"Lorber, J.",,,15292126,,,,"English","Adv.

I would merely add that the essay ""Pour en finir avec la notion du bruit,"" rendered here as ""Let's Have Done with the Notion of 'Noise,' ""poses a peculiar-and indeed intriguing and heuristic-problem of translation. Of course, translations frequently come up against mismatches between source and target languages. Even words that seem to denote primarily the same objects or concepts will often- almost inevitably-connote differently or cover ranges of meaning that do not fully overlap. Further, where the meaning of a word in the source language echoes perfectly the sense of a word in the target language, there is no guarantee that their semantic equivalence will carry over to the level of discourse-to the level of words embedded in sentences and of sentences in context.

I would merely add that the essay ""Pour en finir avec la notion du bruit,"" rendered here as ""Let's Have Done with the Notion of 'Noise,' ""poses a peculiar-and indeed intriguing and heuristic-problem of translation. Of course, translations frequently come up against mismatches between source and target languages. Even words that seem to denote primarily the same objects or concepts will often- almost inevitably-connote differently or cover ranges of meaning that do not fully overlap. Further, where the meaning of a word in the source language echoes perfectly the sense of a word in the target language, there is no guarantee that their semantic equivalence will carry over to the level of discourse-to the level of words embedded in sentences and of sentences in context. It is precisely these idiosyncrasies that are the starting point for the author's reflections, and the reader will want to keep in mind that bruit is precisely not-or rather not just-French for ""noise"" either in meaning or in use.

Coco, who lives at the end of the twentieth century, is like a butterfly leading an outlandish lifestyle.

However, gender issues for women remain unresolved. To fight against traditional patriarchy and especially challenge gender oppression in official feminism, both Sophia and Coco boldly acknowledge and pursue sexual desire.

Of particular interest is the phenomenon of 'wining' or 'wukkin' up', dancing involving pelvic gyrations. The focus is on changes taking place in societies in which there is supposedly the continued dominance of a male patriarchal figure. Can these changes be anything more than a new form of male control of female sexuality and public sexual expression? It seeks to address this question through an analysis of two songs, one a male performed classic competition winning calypso, 'The Black Man feeling to party' and a competition winning calypso sung by a female entitled 'This is what we do'. The former celebrates heterosexual relationships right from the period of partner dancing courtship, through marriage, child rearing and, with child rearing achieved, a return to partner dancing. The latter exalts and justifies the behaviour of women 'wining' alone or on each other. The paper concludes that women are asserting ownership of their own sexuality through auto-sexual dance expression in public.

Some captive Africans on plantations in Jamaica altered their complexion. These Africans modeled the British in the colony who bleached their skin to protect the ""superior,"" ""sexy,"" and ideal white skin from the ""impurities"" of interracial sex and the tropical climate. The beauty and sexual attraction accorded to light skin was also evident in skin bleaching newspaper ads in the 1950s. The ads told women that acquiring light complexion through skin bleaching would make them sexually attractive to men. The persistence of colorism and its most blatant expression-skin bleaching-is also evident in contemporary Jamaica as expressed in some dancehall songs which praise skin bleachers, and the explanatory narratives of skin bleachers that bleaching makes them pretty and sexually attractive to potential spouses. Similar themes are reflected in the criticism that the browning Dancehall Queen Carlene was deemed sexually attractive and choreographically talented only because of her brown physicality. Some spouses request that their partner acquire the bleached physicality because they find it sexually attractive similar to many male clients in ""massage parlors"" who only request female sex workers who bleach their skin. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Colorism; Complexion; Jamaica; Sexual attraction; Skin bleaching",,"Charles, C.

Again in 2009 a further one hundred and twenty-four (124) Jamaican adults were interviewed to determine their perceptions of the current gender stereotypes. The same was done in Barbados as a means of comparing the stereotypes of two English speaking Caribbean cultures with differing degrees of exposure to similar cultural influences. Equal numbers of male and female respondents were included in both studies. A 100-adjective list of male and female attributes was compiled using a 300-item list originally created by Cattell in 1943 and subsequently used and revised by various authors. The data were analysed using SPSS to arrive at the frequencies for each adjective. Responses of 65% or more were considered to be stereotypical of males and females within each culture. The results show that overall Jamaican men were seen as: coarse, reckless, aggressive, lazy, tough, arrogant, stern, disorderly, robust, rigid, autocratic, courageous, and hard-headed, Jamaican women were seen as: complaining, fussy, sexy, emotional, worrying, affectionate, sensitive, soft hearted and sophisticated. Barbadian men and women had overall lower stereotype scores than did Jamaicans. Barbadian men differed from Jamaican men in that they were seen as: reckless; disorderly; robust and tough man who is also show-off; arrogant; aggressive; hard-headed; courageous, adventurous; lazy; inventive and rigid, while Barbadian women were seen as: emotional; fussy; affectionate; complaining, sophisticated; sensitive; worrying; warm; fault-finding; sexy; touchy; sentimental and gentle. The popular music from both countries is used as a lens for understanding the cultures within which the respondents develop their gender stereotypes. The stereotype data is then compared with the music that is popular during the 10 years from the first study in Jamaica to the second pair of studies in Jamaica and Barbados. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adjectives; Adults; Barbados; Children; Jamaica; Sex role; Stereotype",,"Carpenter, K.; Department of Language, Linguistics and Philosophy, University of the West Indies, Mona, Kingston 7, Jamaica; email: karen.carpenter@uwimona.edu.jm",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

In contrast, most that live with scars must after the fact either reconcile their changed bodies with those norms or change their ideas to better match their changed bodies. This article uses narratives written by 284 male and female college students to explore the meanings individuals assign to unwanted scars, focusing on what this process tells us about the gendered body. The three most common meanings-scars as reminders of overcoming adversity, reminders of loved ones, and markers of athleticism-occur equally often in narratives written by men and women.

This study examines another aspect of the interaction between gender and the economy that has been largely ignored by social scientists-gender-based disparities in the cost of goods and services in the personal care industry. We examine prices charged for personal care products and services that are targeted toward women or men and find that women pay more than men for certain items and services. Our research suggests that although the differences are not uniform across types of services or products, women do tend to pay more than men for items such as deodorant, haircuts, and dry-cleaning. We suggest that such practices contribute to gender inequality by increasing women's economic burden and reinforcing essentialist thinking about gender (i. e., that women and men are biologically different). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Consumer products; Doing gender; Price disparities; Sociology of the body",,"Grauerholz, L.; University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, United States; email: Elizabeth.grauerholz@ucf.edu",,,1098092X,,,,"English","Gender Issues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055124791

The few studies exploring the lived experiences of childless women have been conducted in America, Canada and the United Kingdom; predominantly during the 1980s and 1990s. The experiences of childless women in contemporary Australia remain under-researched. This hermeneutic phenomenological study sought to enhance understanding of the lived experience of being a childless woman in contemporary Australia. In-depth interviews with five childless women revealed five key themes as significant facets of the experiences of childless women: notions of 'natural' and 'unnatural'; woman = mother; childlessness as a discrediting attribute; feeling undervalued; and the significance of being childless. By privileging the experiences of childless women in a pronatalist society, it is apparent that misconceptions and stereotypes about childlessness continue to pervade. This study contributes to understanding this growing population group; highlighting that while childlessness is increasingly acknowledged, it is still not completely understood. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Childlessness; Femininity; Pronatalism; Stereotypes; Stigma",,"Rich, S.; Centre for Health Through Action on Social Exclusion (CHASE), School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, VIC 3125, Australia; email: s.rich@deakin.edu.au",,,1098092X,,,,"English","Gender Issues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80955143726

It argues that changes in medical technologies and information technologies have made self-abortions safer and more accessible, while structural and cultural barriers have limited access to legal abortions. While some feminists and reproductive rights advocates have problematized the practice of self-aborting itself as dangerous and indicative of the deterioration of the rights guaranteed under Roe v Wade, this paper suggests that feminists must turn their attentions to changing the terms under which abortion is treated under the law. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Abortion law; Medical abortion; Misoprostol; Roe v Wade; Self-abortion",,"Hayden, T.

Although one would be hard pressed to identify contemporary scholars who promote this sort of generationally bound progress narrative, the story persists.

Yet, despite meat carrying connotations that offer provocative connection with feminist concerns regarding the body, consumption and the cultural representation of women, meat consciousness has been only sporadically explored in existing feminist theory. Struck, however, by the comparisons between the dissected Body Worlds corpse and the filleted flesh of meat that are levelled most particularly at female bodies on display, I examine in my article the bodily relations constructed in the Body Worlds exhibition by positioning the Body Worlds cadaver as a grotesque 'meaty' body under the broader rubric of the Bakhtinian carnivalesque. Within such webs of alimentary exchange, pleats of meaty matter may bring about localised eruptions of traditional and bodily engagements - including that of the gendered gaze - that entwine the possibility of pleasure, wonder and fascination into each act of inter-bodily engagement.

I argue that before we can embark on any metaphysical inquiry - feminist or otherwise - we are doomed to repeating Immanuel Kant's monumental question of how is metaphysics possible? I then ask how metaphysics is understood in feminist discussions and focus on one contemporary effort to create feminist metaphysics, namely Christine Battersby's The Phenomenal Woman: Feminist Metaphysics and the Patterns of Identity (1998). Through a critical analysis of her position I tease out the problems, paradoxes and obstacles that the project of feminist metaphysics faces.

Pheromones were defined by Karlson and Lüscher in 1959 as 'substances which are secreted to the outside by an individual and received by a second individual of the same species, in which they release a specific reaction - for example, a definite behavior or a developmental process'. In humans, it remains unclear whether substances act as pheromones. With reference to Butler, I show how heteronormativity as a discourse influences research on two potential human pheromones, androstadienone and estratetraenol. I argue that experiments on these two substances have been set up to combine sex-specificity, heterosexuality and reproduction. In these experiments, only the inconsistent effects of androstadienone and estratetraenol were demonstrated. With reference to Barad, I interpret this inconsistency as an indicator of 'resistant matter'. I argue that in order to experimentally show 'heteronormative pheromones' materialities (pheromones) have to merge with discourse (heteronormativity). Androstadienone and estratetraenol partly refuse this collaboration. Finally, I refer to Mol's concept of multiple realities and discuss whether alternative, non-heteronormative effects of pheromones occur instead. © The Author(s) 2011.","heteronormativity; intra-action; multiplicity; new materialism; pheromone; posthumanist performativity",,"Sieben, A.; Fakultät für Sozialwissenschaft, Lehrstuhl für Sozialtheorie und Sozialpsychologie, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Universitätsstraße 150, 44780 Bochum, Germany; email: anna.sieben@rub.de",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Three aspects of girl industries are discussed. Firstly, girl idols are de-humanized and become cultural content of girl industries and girl bodies are objectified as normative commodities under corporate government mentality. Next, girl bodies are re-sexualized and their sexuality is featured as the sexuality of ambiguity in split and doubling modes of visualization. Finally, the national governance of girl bodies is examined in terms of the building up of the idol republic and the emergence of Lolita nationalism. The three interrelated aspects of commercialization, re-sexualization and nationalization suggest that girl industries are intrinsic to the strengthening of the neoliberal governmentality of girl bodies on a global scale. This reality calls for a renewed global perspective of critical feminism in order to interrogate the emerging neoliberal body politics and to propose an alternative vision against its normative governmentality in the subjectification of girl bodies. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cultural content; girl industry; globalization; idol republic; Lolita nationalism",,"Kim, Y.; School of Communications, Kwangwoon University, Seoul, South Korea; email: yeran@kw.ac.kr",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

By challenging the distinction between female genital cutting and cosmetic surgery, 'Cut' compels us to reconsider the ways and the purposes for which we make use of the law. The second half of the article will consider the ways in which 'Cut', much like Butler, frames its response to these tensions in primarily individual terms. I argue that the valuing of individual over collective action risks making effective activism appear impossible and leaves both writers unable to explore crucial means of collective response to the issues to which they rightly and astutely draw attention. Finally I consider some of the possibilities for collective action arising from 'Cut' that resonate with successful activism in the real world, that are not fully explored in the text. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","female genital cutting; Judith Butler; law; science fiction; the body",,"Roberts, J.; Department of English, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom; email: aexjr@nottingham.ac.uk",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

This paper focuses on two such little-known unpublished stories: 'Uncle Robert's Wedding Present' (1908) and 'Teaching Him' (1909), discussing ways their entanglements with questions of marriage and economics are grounded in Franklin's work and personal life and in the intellectual influences that shaped her writing. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Lee, J.; Women Studies at Oregon State UniversityUnited States",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

Most health outcomes and health risk factors are inversely correlated with social class: people with better education, better jobs and higher incomes typically enjoy better health. By comparison, gender differences in health are quite variable, depending on the health outcome or risk of interest. Furthermore, the distribution of any given risk factor tends to vary from society to society, from time to time, and between specific sub-populations. Public health research rarely considers class and gender together. In this paper we summarise and problematise the interplay between gender and class in empirical research on the 'problem' of obesity. We suggest that some of the difficulties in explaining research findings arise from limitations in the evidence base used to measure obesity, conceptual 'slippage' between key terms like gender and sex, and an erasure of social class from academic language. It is via an examination of these issues that underpin current obesity research that we offer more innovative and effective ways to approach the underlying theoretical and health promotion problems. Nevertheless, we acknowledge the considerable practical and intellectual challenges of analysing and reporting social determinants like gender and class in an environment that demands certain kinds of scientific evidence. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Broom, D.

This analysis of the work parents of gender variant children do to explain their children to others demonstrates that these identities require a distinctly modern form of accounting. With that call to articulate the self comes an attendant proliferation of the ways in which gender can be regulated; yet, despite much sociological evidence that medicine, psychology and spirituality are often mechanisms for social control, they also provide ready tools for exploring, facilitating and embracing the multiplicity and plasticity of contemporary gender identities. © 2011 The Author(s).","children; gender; knowledge; parents; transgender",,"Meadow, T.; Society of Fellows, Princeton University, Joseph Henry House, Princeton, NJ 08542, United States; email: tmeadow@princeton.edu",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857771524

Using data from open-ended essays, I explore three aspects of strategic outness: strategies, motivational discourses, and social relationships. My participants discuss using multiple strategies to manage who knows about their sexuality, cohesively describe multiple motivations for controlling that information, and emphasize the role of social relationships in their decision-making.

By combining a broad survey of Amsterdam youth with in-depth interviews with smaller groups and individual attackers and reviewing recent cases, we conclude that traditional norms of gender and sexuality present in broader society form the breeding ground of the violence. The gay-friendly narrative that dominates discussions on citizenship in the Netherlands - opposing the liberal 'Dutch' to the Muslim 'Other' - coexists next to traditional norms of gender and sexuality, thereby not challenging the roots of homonegativity. Even perpetrators duplicate the prevailing gay-tolerant rhetoric of Dutch society, but do not refrain from all sorts of violence as soon as they are confronted with aspects of it that collide with traditional norms of gender and sexuality. Peer pressure and the fear of seduction often function as triggers of the violence. However, these situational factors can only be understood in a larger macro-sociological framework, showing the necessity of a multilevel approach in coming towards a comprehensive understanding of antigay violence. © 2011 The Author(s).","antigay violence; Dutch citizenship; heteronormativity; homophobia; Islamophobia",,"Buijs, L.; Amsterdam Research Centre for Gender and Sexuality, University of Amsterdam, Kloveniersburgwal 48, 1012 CX Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: l.j.buijs@uva.nl",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857697940

Ironically, as physical access to education in this area has increased, women's literacy experiences have become more complex, rather than more libratory. Formal literacy, as it plays out for women in this community, is experienced as both an oppressive force as well as a tool for resistance to other forms of oppression. More importantly, the stories in this article highlight the socially dynamic nature of literacy as these four women utilise interpersonal relationships in order to subvert oppressive norms. These findings have implications both for theories of literacy as well as for educators who wish to work in more engaged ways with women and their children who emigrate from areas like rural Mexico. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ethnography; literacy; Mexico; oppression; resistance; women",,"Meyers, S.

I argue that in being the earliest form of education for most Muslim women and also a neglected topic of scholarly interest, the Qur'anic school shapes their feminisms in more significant ways than has been acknowledged since scholarly attention to Islamic education in West Africa has mostly focused on the experience of boys in Qur'anic schools, and since theories on feminism in Islam have primarily articulated feminism as a politically oriented project. Using Islamic feminism as a disposition that is not always coterminous with activist objectives within the sociohistorical context of Islamic education in West African Muslim societies, this paper emphasizes the need to focus on forms of female literacy other than secular education. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","education; faith and religion; femininities; girls; Islam; Muslims",,"Edwin, S.; Foreign Languages, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, TX, United States; email: see001@shsu.edu",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858809185

The article grounds its argument in an exploration of how post-feminism and feminism intersect with sixth form students' subjectivities through the educational practices of their second-year A Level subject-based research. The article analyses empirical instances of students' discursive agency through Butler's notions of performativity, citationality, excessive signification and re signification to consider the complex, multiple and creative ways in which sixth form students produce themselves as viable gendered subjects in relation to post-feminist and feminist discourses. The analysis considers both how discourse regulates and conditions students' relations with post-feminism and feminism and how discourse contains the possibilities for the subject to refuse the refusal of feminism in popular culture. Through its analysis of how students use their discursive agency to claim a feminist identity, and how these uses constitute transgressive practices, the article explores the political significance of identifications with feminism in doing gender differently. It ends with an argument for the re-consideration of the apparently assured popular cultural 'failure' of feminism in post-feminist neoliberal times. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","discourse; discursive agency; feminism; hope; post-feminism; sixth form students",,"Taylor, C.

These chick dick stories (which adapt elements from the hardboiled detective novel, film noir, chick lit, and chick flicks) repeatedly engage with the gendered power dynamics made visible and problematic through the intersection of chick and crime genres, most particularly the sexualization of violence. In these narratives, popular masculinities operate as deployable concepts to dramatize contemporary gender relations. By tapping into the popular sentiment of a crisis in masculinity, chick dick texts also mobilize a rhetoric of unrepresentable male victimization and individual male pathologies. This strategy highlights the spaces and places in which masculinities are made vulnerable at the same time as it offers simplistic and individualized explanations for the systemic sexualized violence that dominate these narratives. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","crisis; detection; masculinities; postfeminism; sexual violence; victimization",,"Braithwaite, A.; Communication Studies from McGillCanada; email: andrea.braithwaite@mail.mcgill.ca",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

In our study, the authors examined the experiences, benefits, and challenges encountered by wives of college and university presidents. In a relationship where the husband has a prestigious and well-defined role, the female partner may still be expected to play a traditional role on a regular basis, bringing both benefits and challenges. Through focus groups, interviews, and a survey, women shared their experiences. Cluster analytic techniques identified six groups of women that were involved in, adjusted to, or conflicted by serving in the presidential spouse role. The authors employ the voices of the women themselves to illuminate their experiences, satisfactions, challenges, and frustrations. Wives indicated that they had to deal with loss of privacy, conflicted personal relationships, and increased ambiguity about their own identity. Interestingly, wives did not allow these challenges to undermine their marriage; instead, for those who had difficulty meeting these demands, the loss was to their own sense of self-worth. The results suggest that the role of presidential wife should be examined through the intersectional lens of gender and class. This intersection can be seen to shape the expectations of the wife herself, as well as the demands made by her spouse and others in her community. Her previous experiences, education, and career preparation provide insights into how she approaches the public role. Recognizing and giving voice to the complex sociocultural issues involved may help wives thrive in their roles as a college or university president's wife.

Ironically, although receiving emotional support contributes to emotional and physical health, providing emotional support may be distressing as a result of emotional contagion. Women have been found to be more susceptible than men to emotional contagion in certain contexts, but no studies examined the context of providing support to a troubled friend in a naturalistic setting. Our exploratory study aimed to test for gender differences in emotional contagion as a result of offering emotional support to a troubled friend. We studied naturalistic informal supportive interactions among 48 pairs of friends. Following an 8-min interaction with a troubled friend, (a) women were more likely than men to experience a deterioration in their positive emotional state and (b) changes in women's emotional state were positively correlated with changes in their troubled friends' emotional state, whereas changes in male support providers' emotional state were unrelated to changes in their troubled friends' emotional state. These results suggest that women are more susceptible than men to emotional contagion following brief interactions with a troubled friend, thereby highlighting the importance of conducting additional research into the costs and benefits of exchanging emotional support among friends. © The Author(s) 2011.","emotional contagion; emotional support; friendship; human sex differences; interpersonal communication; social interaction; social support",,"Magen, E.; Center for Counseling and Psychological Services, University of Pennsylvania, 133 S. 36th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States; email: eranm@upenn.edu",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

Black sexual minority women who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are a part of three demographic groups likely to experience adolescent pregnancy. A paucity of research has examined why these young women become pregnant. The authors begin to address this gap by examining the meaning of pregnancy from young women's perspective. Modified grounded theory was used to analyze data from interviews with 14 young Black sexual minority women, aged 16-24. Pregnancies, intentional and unintentional, were common among the participants and within their sexual minority community. Pregnancy affirmed sexual identity and same-sex relationships as well as garnered sexual and reproductive agency. Participants' pregnancy experiences contradicted the belief that young women sought or valued pregnancy because it provided access to heterosexual privilege. Although the main functions of intentional pregnancies did not differ drastically from those of young heterosexual women, we argue that these young women's pregnancy and parenting desires may be magnified because of the particular realities they face as sexual minority women. Further, we situate our analysis within the context of a Black cultural environment and argue that pregnancy and motherhood may be adaptive subsistence strategies for women who are largely socially devalued. © The Author(s) 2011.","adolescent mothers; Blacks; identity formation; lesbianism; pregnancy; sexual orientation; sexuality",,"Reed, S.

Female offenders are a unique population because they experience high rates of sexual assault prior to incarceration. This study recruited 74 women at a U.S. state prison, who experienced sexual assault prior to incarceration to explore the associations among rape myth acceptance (RMA), disclosure, and reporting of sexual assaults to the authorities. Participants were asked open-ended questions regarding why they chose to disclose their sexual assaults to others, to report to the police, or to remain silent. Narratives were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for thematic content. Women's narratives, particularly those of women who indicated that they remained silent, frequently included a variety of rape myths that involved blaming themselves for the rape, fearing not being believed, believing that familiar perpetrators cannot be rapists, and questioning whether the event was really a rape. Women often described such rape myth beliefs with greater frequency than discussing situational characteristics of the rape as reasons for nonreporting. Implications for these findings in clinical, research, and social justice contexts are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","abuse reporting; rape; self-disclosure; sexual abuse; social support; stigma; victimization",,"Heath, N.

A sample of 101 women, aged between 35 and 55 years, completed questionnaire measures of media exposure, thin-ideal internalization, social comparison, appearance investment, aging anxiety, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating. Television, but not magazine exposure, was positively related to body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. In contrast, both television and magazine exposure were positive correlates of all four proposed media-processing variables (internalization, social comparison, appearance investment, and aging anxiety), which were themselves positive correlates of both body dissatisfaction and disordered eating. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of media exposure was fully mediated by the proposed media processes. The analyses also indicated that our proposed sociocultural model of disordered eating provided a reasonably good fit to the data, suggesting that sociocultural theory can be extended to women of middle-age. An important practical implication of this finding is that strategies aimed at challenging and minimizing these media processes may reduce some of the negative impact of media exposure in middle-aged women. © The Author(s) 2011.","aging (attitudes toward); body image; eating behavior; eating disorders; mass media; midlife; physical appearance; self-concept; social comparison",,"Slevec, J.; School of Psychology, Flinders University, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; email: julie.slevec@flinders.edu.au",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

Previous studies have examined how social system personnel treat survivors, but less attention has been paid to how survivors attempt to shape their interactions with these systems. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine rape survivors' agency-the active process in which they engaged to alter their experiences with the legal and medical systems. In-depth face-to-face interviews were conducted with 20 female rape survivors who had contact with the police and a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program. Analytic induction was the guiding analytic approach. Findings indicate that this group of survivors engaged in three agentic processes in their interactions with the legal and medical systems: compliance in order to increase the likelihood their case would achieve what they deemed to be a successful outcome, defiance through noncompliance in order to protect themselves from further harm, and defiance by challenging the response to their case in order to alter the response to their case. Based on these findings, possible strategies for facilitating survivors' participation and agency during their help-seeking experiences (e.g., systemic changes to empower survivors, improving the responsiveness of system personnel to survivors' needs) are discussed.

The purpose of this study was to investigate women's decisions about whether to label their experiences as rape. Participants were 77 college women (predominantly White; mean age = 19.23) who had experienced rape according to the study's operational definition. The researchers used open-ended questionnaires and interviews to explore participants' explanations for labeling or not labeling their experience as rape. Explanations were related to match-whether the incident matched their rape script (e.g., whether the man fit their image of a rapist; whether they fought back)-and to motivation-the perceived consequences of using the label (e.g., discomfort with thinking of the perpetrator as a rapist; feeling less self-blame vs. feeling less control or more traumatized). Over time, participants were more likely to label their experience as rape. Results suggested that individuals differ in the meanings that they ascribe to the label rape. For some individuals, labeling their experience as rape may be adaptive; for others, it may be unhelpful or even harmful. Researchers, clinicians, and advocates should use caution in imposing their own preferred labels on other women's experiences. © The Author(s) 2011.","acquaintance rape; cognitive appraisal; labeling; match-and-motivation model; motivation; naming; nonconsensual sexual experiences; rape; rape acknowledgment; rape scripts; schema; sexual assault; sexual attitudes; unacknowledged rape; unwanted sexual experiences",,"Peterson, Z.

We reflect on their differing points of view, attempt clarifications, and then re-state our central concern in regard to research ethics in studies of violence against women. We think that IRB-oriented approaches suffer from too much rule adherence, too much focus on doing things the right way and too little attention to the larger ethical question of to how figure out the right things to do. We continue to raise concern about inept research as potentially damaging to a class of persons, not to the specific subjects of any particular study. Thus, we see not just a matter of poor design, mishandling of analyses, or even of clumsy inferences from the data in some research; these errors are correctible by better training and review. But these errors also have the potential for misleading the public and policy makers and thus suggest ethical dimensions to clumsy work. We conclude by proposing use of wide reflective equilibrium as a way of entering into deeper dialogue about the complex ethical issues surrounding this field of research. Hopefully, we can move beyond mere rule compliance to seriously considering the end effects of our science. © SAGE Publications 2011.","ethics of violence research; justice in research; research ethics",,"Walker, R.; Department of Behavioral Science, University of Kentucky, 333 Waller Ave., Suite 480, Lexington, KY 40504, United States; email: Robert.walker@uky.edu",,,10778012,,,,"English","Violence Against Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858037486

Previous work has analyzed the overt and hidden risks of harm to study participants through poorly designed and implemented protocols, cross-cultural insensitivity, unjust exclusion of certain victim types, and neglect to ensure safety of research staff. This article extends this work by calling for greater attention to exploiting participants and victims as a class of persons. The need for this wider view derives from concern about the academic research environment with its emphasis on research, publication, and extramural funding. The authors argue that compliance with federal regulations and IRB directives is necessary but insufficient to conduct truly ethical research. Recognition of the unique pressures that researchers face in the context of the economically competitive university is required to delineate and manage exploitation risks. Such pressures have sometimes led to the rush from print to practices and policies with unintended harmful results for victims of violence as a class of persons.

Specifically, women who aspire to personal and professional development on the basis of more egalitarian gender role models must deal with the traditional stereotypes that maintain an intensive maternity mandate that prioritizes the family. On the other hand, for men the role change is primarily in the family setting with the development of a new father role more involved in the care of their children, which is not easily compatible with the more traditional breadwinner role. This study explored the feelings of guilt about parenting in 251 employed Spanish parents with children between 3 and 6 years of age, through the Scale of Guilt Feelings about Parenting, and its relationship with traditional stereotypes of maternal and family role. The scale addresses diverse situations pertaining to child rearing in which work requirements do not allow parents full availability for the care of their children. This availability is present in the model of intensive maternity and in the new father role model. Results indicate the presence of similar and high levels of guilt in fathers and mothers, although in men guilt is related to a non-traditional family role ideology, whereas in women guilt is related to a more traditional maternal role stereotype. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Dual-earner families; Family gender role; Fathers; Mothers; Parental guilt",,"Martínez, P.; Departamento de Psicología, Universidad Pontificia Comillas de Madrid, C/Universidad Comillas 3, 28049 Madrid, Spain; email: mapi@chs.upcomillas.es",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82255162955

Drawing from these sources, assertive strategies were operationalized as involving attempts to isolate women, to compete with other men, and to tease or insult women. The present investigation examined whether hostile and benevolent sexism and sociosexuality, the degree to which individuals require closeness and commitment prior to engaging in sex, were associated with the reported use of assertive strategies by men and the reported positive reception to those strategies by women. It was predicted men and women who were more sexist and had an unrestricted sociosexuality would report using more and being more receptive to assertive strategies. Study 1 (N = 363) surveyed a Midwestern undergraduate college student sample, and regression results indicated that sociosexuality was associated with assertive strategy preference and use, but sexism only predicted a positive reception of assertive strategies by women. Study 2 (N = 850) replicated these results by surveying a larger, national U. S. volunteer sample via the internet. In addition to confirming the results of Study 1, regression results from Study 2 indicated that hostile sexism was predictive of reported assertive strategy use by men, suggesting that outside of the college culture, sexism is more predictive of assertive strategy use.

One hundred and thirteen men and 174 of their female colleagues from eastern parts of Germany and working in the healthcare and educational sectors completed hard-copy questionnaires. We used bootstrapped regression models to test for direct effects, controlling for autonomy, working hours, professional tenure, and sector of work.

The attitudes of female colleagues toward male anti-femininity were directly related to heightened depressive moods and lowered job satisfaction.

Sexual scripts are culturally determined patterns of behavior that inform desire and influence sexual behavior. Sexual scripts include hook up, seduction, rape, and acquaintance rape scripts (e. g., the too-much-to drink script, the man-is-ready-for-sex script, and the friends-gone-too-far script). However, research shows that many individuals still hold an erroneous real rape script, even when asked to describe acquaintance rape. This may prevent acquaintance rape victims from acknowledging their rape and it may allow acquaintance rapists to engage in sexual aggression while denying it is rape. Rape scripts research supports several of the rape myths reviewed by Edwards and her colleagues (Edwards, Turchik, Dardis, Reynolds, & Gidycz, 2011), but suggests two additional rape myths (i. e., the myth that men cannot stop once they have started to become sexually aroused and the myth that rapists are obviously different from other men). The study of the relationship between rape myths and sexual scripts may help to understand the social construction of rape and consensual sex.

Chi-square and MANOVA analyses replicated previous findings of the expected gender difference in all hypothetical forced-choice scenarios. However, results for those participants who reported experience with actual infidelity demonstrated little support for the traditional evolutionary model, as there were no gender differences in which aspect of hypothetical infidelity was reported to be more distressing, and no gender differences at the college level in terms of which aspect of infidelity received the greatest focus. These findings, extrapolated from both undergraduates and adults and accounting for the impact of actual, primed memory of experience of infidelity on hypothetical jealousy scenarios, raise important questions about the validity of hypothetical scenarios of jealousy as proxies for real reactions to actual infidelity. The results of the present study suggest that the lack of a consistent, replicable gender difference across the lifespan may be explained by two related factors: age and actual experience with infidelity. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Continuous-scale methodology; Evolutionary theory; Gender differences; Jealousy",,"Varga, C.

In this paper, I consider how gender and money shaped medical realities in the early modern Ottoman Empire. People of means certainly had more medical options available to them, although that did not necessarily lead to better results. Gender too was naturally an important factor, molding medical options and the relationship between patient and healer. The specific case of the imperial harem will reveal how high socio-economic status has actually curbed women's medical options, as their access to male doctors was limited. Based on Ottoman archival and legal sources and European travel literature, the paper examines how and why they were limited, and how they went about circumventing such restrictions.

Facebook and blogging allow these women to speak freely to one another and encourage them to form groups. These platforms are useful not only for coalescing around key social and political issues pertaining to women, but also for initiating social change. Women utilizing online social networking are using new forms of feminist discourse-and the technology to fuel such discourse-to promote change from within. What is also happening is a revolution in the way these women are approaching Islam.

These narratives were implicit critiques of middle-class society. Although research on earlier novels of the Nahda authored by men has gradually increased over the last few decades, research on women writers and their novels is still in its infancy. This essay focuses mainly on Riwayat Saiba (1891), written by Alice Bustani (1870-1926), daughter of one of the prominent intellectuals of the nahda, Butrus al-Bustani (1819-1883). It discusses these novels as social and historical texts, and describes how writing narrative fiction allowed women to express their opinions without excluding themselves from society and its norms. Women challenged male discourse by modifying the plots and messages of their novels, thus proposing alternative discourses and criticizing the existing one.

We conclude that when GA models are used to support calls for retrenchment of public spending on pensions and other social programs that target the older population, it makes sense to recognize that the potential benefits with respect to government debt and deficit reduction and reduced inequality in net tax burdens across age cohorts may come at the cost of increased intragenerational inequality for many workers and retirees. © The Authors.","Generational accounting; Inequality; Intergenerational equity; Pension policy; Social security",,"Williamson, J.

The meaning of the idea of active ageing is based on the concept of individuals actively and systematically influencing the conditions of their ageing through self-responsibility and self-care. The aim of this article is to map how the idea of active ageing is constructed and the implications it presents with regard to the way in which seniors relate to their experience of old age. It concentrates on a specific segment of senior-oriented social services (centres for seniors that offer leisure time activities and educational courses) that represent an institutional context for the manifestation of the discourse of active ageing. A three-year ethnographic study was conducted in two such centres in the Czech Republic. The article focuses on various strategies for the disciplining of the ageing body. It points out that these disciplinary practices are an integral part of the daily running of the centres and that the seniors who intensively engage in them have internalised the idea of an active lifestyle as the most desirable lifestyle in old age. Active ageing was constructed by them as a project that must be worked on. Through the ""technologies of self"" embedded in the imperative of the necessity to move or do something, they participate in the production of the discourse of active ageing as a form of discipline of the body. At the same time, the article outlines how the idea of active ageing as the ""correct"" form of ageing influences the self-conception of these seniors and their attitudes towards ageing and their peers. © The Author.","Active ageing; Ethnography; Governmentality; Leisure; Lifestyle; Third age",,"Marhánková, J.

Boards of directors are primarily male; globally, only 5-20 per cent of directors are women and change is described as glacially slow. The extent to which women directors are central to the network, or pushed to the margins, is unknown. Using the tools of social network analysis we extract the components of three director networks, a global and two national networks and locate the women directors. The paper aims to examine the persistence of director networks over time to determine whether gender related differences – apart from size – contribute to the apparent resistance to change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a longitudinal approach, comparing director networks on a global network scale (2004 and 2007 Fortune Global 200) and a national one (2004 and 2007 New Zealand Stock Exchange) with the iconic 1999 Fortune US 1000 dataset. After extracting the largest connected component, the female directors are separated out. From the 2004 and 2007 data director turnover is calculated to determine the stability of the networks. Findings – Female directors are more likely to be found in the largest connected component of the mixed gender network, indicating that they are not marginalised. Despite high turnover rates, director networks are stable over time which may manifest as resistance to change. Originality/value – The structure of gendered director networks is unknown and the location of women directors in the network components has not been considered in board diversity research.

The global corporate food system, however, allows 800 million to go hungry, while an even larger number of people grow obese.

Drawing on a research project into the participation of women in community development projects in three areas of Nepal, the present article examines how far development agencies in the post-conflict period have succeeded in furthering women's citizenship rights, and in giving voice to women's concerns and participation. It argues that development organisations and agencies have continued to operate mostly without including the voices of women, and women are disappointed by these non-participatory and top-down development models, which are leaving women's status as second-class citizens unchallenged. Women are consequently exploring alternatives. The article uses examples from the field and interviews and focus groups with marginalised women and non-government organisation workers to suggest ways in which development agencies can work with participatory models to advance women's citizenship rights. Given the diversity of social groups and peoples and gender relations in Nepal, the present article will also raise critical questions about the form and content of women's participation, and the intersections of gender, class, caste, and ethnicity on citizenship rights. © 2011 Copyright Oxfam GB.","citizenship; Nepal; NGOs; women's participation",,"Pant, B.; School of Sociology, Social Policy and Criminology, University of Liverpool, 80 Tramway Road, Liverpool L17 7AZ, United Kingdom; email: bijanpant@gmail.com",,,13552074,,,,"English","Gender Dev.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859032591

Its main objective was to inquire into the connections between thinking on citizenship, and Filipino young women's activism, where in the contemporary Philippine socio-political milieu, issues of 'belonging' and 'exclusion' are still being negotiated. The workshops revealed that young women continue to face traditional structural barriers that inhibit them from actively participating in political debate and public life. However, they have created new spaces for asserting varied(re)conceptions of citizenship and gender justice, often mediated by rapidly changing information and communication technologies. Likewise, they are increasingly on the move: the face of labour migration in the Philippines is that of a young woman. How then might migration change our understandings of citizenship?

On the other hand, they practise Bangladeshi culture at home, which often entails patriarchal elements. At the junction of these two identities, religion (Islam) works as a guiding principle, and as a uniting tool in their personal as well as public lives.

This, however, also raises fundamental questions about different understandings of citizenship and citizenship rights. © 2011 Copyright Oxfam GB.","citizenship; feminist organising; gender identity; gender-based violence; social movement",,"Cooper, M.; UN Women, 5/F UN Building, Rajdamnern Nok Ave, Bangkok 10200, Thailand; email: meghancoop@gmail.com",,,13552074,,,,"English","Gender Dev.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859040701

Design/methodology/approach: The study employed a purposive sampling technique to recruit 15 self-identified ""feminist entrepreneurs"". This included retailers, manufacturers, exploration operators, consultants, and professionals. Qualitative data were subject to content analysis. Findings: Contrary to a feminine archetype portrayed as caring and nurturing, respondents do not describe themselves as typically portrayed in the feminist literature. Prevalent themes included participative leadership, action-oriented, and creative thinker/or problem solver. Research limitations/implications: Researchers should use caution in assuming feminist discourse has direct application to characterizing or stereotyping ""feminist"" entrepreneurs. The applicability and reliability of ""off the shelf"" psychometrics to describe contemporary gender roles across the myriads of processes associated with venture creation must also be questioned. Limitations: the purposive and small-sample limits the generalizability of findings to the diverse community of female entrepreneurs. Testing of the applicability, validity, and reliability of the nomenclature used to describe self-identity is warranted across international samples of feminist entrepreneurs. Practical implications: The current study provides an inventory of feminist entrepreneurs' self-described leadership attributes. The nomenclature can be used by women-focused trainers to help clients to recognize their entrepreneurial attributes. Social implications: The study may assist women in recognizing identity synergies and conflicts (e.g. within themselves and among family, employees, clients, etc.). Originality/value: This is the first study that documents feminist entrepreneurs' leadership attributes. As such, the work is a step in seeking to reconcile feminist theory and entrepreneurial practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurs; Feminism; Leadership",,"Orser, B.

The paper aims to focus on the experiences of two groups of female and male managers in two diverse countries and how these groups of employees view career advancement and how this perspective may relate to the lack of women in senior managerial roles. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts deductive reasoning to understand social practice as a means by which and how senior management identities are perceived and whether these roles are attainable. A survey was administered to female and male managers in Malaysia and in Australia. Findings: The findings indicate that women in two countries studied still have significant responsibilities for performing family duties, and bringing up children. In particular, the Malaysian respondents viewed family and personal responsibilities as their greatest impediment to attaining senior management positions. Hence, they are unable to contemplate both careers and families, a view strongly supported by the Australian women as well. Originality/value: Societal expectations on women in certain cultures are still strongly entrenched because they believe that they are required to comply with the social roles by prioritising marital obligations over any desire for senior management careers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Asia-Pacific; Australia; Barriers to progress; Career advancement; Malaysia; Managers",,"Jogulu, U.; School of Management and Marketing, Deakin University, Burwood, Australia; email: uma.jogulu@deakin.edu.au",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-81055143991

The results demonstrated that women's perspectives-from official sources to private civilians' voices-are still scarce in war reporting. Women also accounted for only a fifth of the bylines and were mostly quoted as private individuals-representing less than a tenth of the subjects cited.

Through a discourse analysis of a documentary film about Weblogistan and interviews with diasporic Iranian bloggers in Toronto, I argue that Weblogistan is implicated in discourses of militarism and neoliberalism that interpellate the representable Iranian blogger as a gendered neoliberal homo oeconomicus. The production of knowledge about Iran in transnational encounters between the media, think tanks, policy institutions and the Iranian diasporic self-entrepreneurs, relies on gendered civilizational discourses that are inherently tied to the war on terror. Following feminist scholars who have theorized militarism and gender, I argue that dominant representations of Weblogistan produce different gendered subject positions for Iranian bloggers. Although the masculine blogger soldier takes freedom to Iran through his active participation in proper politics (enabled by his freedom of speech in North America and Europe), the woman blogger finds freedom of expression in writing about sex and telling the truth of her sex in a confessional mode. It is in this war of representation that women bloggers negotiate their subjectivity while shuttling in and out of local and global politics, as subjects of politics (markers of freedom and oppression) and political abjects (not worthy of political participation). © 2011 Feminist Review.","cybergovernmentality; gender; militarism; neoliberalism; new media; representation",,"Shakhsari, S.; Women'S, Gender and Sexuality Studies Programme, University of HoustonUnited States",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Triangulating data gathered through large-scale surveys, interviews and textual analysis of IM transcripts, we focus on Moroccan-Dutch girls who use instant messaging as a space where they can negotiate several issues at the crossroads of national, ethnic, racial, age and linguistic specificities. We take an intersectional perspective to disentangle how they perform differential selves using IM both as an onstage activity through which they express their communal, public and global youth cultural belongings and as a backstage activity through which they articulate their individual, private and intimate identity expression. Instant messaging appears to be a space where they can strategically (re-)position themselves. The relationship between the online world of IM and the off-line world is shown to be intricate and complex; at certain points, both worlds overlap and at others they diverge. Despite all existing constraints that are both related to gender restrictions, often disenfranchised family backgrounds, religious dictums, and surveillance by parents, siblings and peers, which affect Moroccan-Dutch girls in specific ways, IM is also understood as a unique space for exerting their agency in autonomous, playful and intimate ways. © 2011 Feminist Review.","adolescent migrant girls; communicative space; instant messaging; intersectionality; Moroccan-Dutch youth; performativity of self",,"Leurs, K.; Gender Studies at Utrecht University (NL), Research Institute of History and CultureNetherlands",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

In contrast to dominant narratives in which single women are pathologised, in the blogs by, for, and about single women analysed here, writers aim to refigure women's singleness as well as providing resources, support and a textual community where others can intervene and contribute to the re-valuation of single women. These blogs also function as alternative forms of knowledge, seeking to (re)legitimise women's singleness and to trouble their aberrance and social liminality. Rather than only considering the form in isolation from its content, this article analyses the discourses deployed by bloggers and within blogs and how women bloggers publicly perform their very singleness as part of a personal and political strategy of re-signification. In this way, while cautious not to overestimate the democratic potentialities of the so-called blogosphere, it underscores the important cultural-and indeed political-work being undertaken by single women therein. Moreover, by demonstrating how these blogs use discursive tactics commonly associated with feminism's second-wave-women's consciousness-raising; identity politics; deploying and reiterating the famous feminist dictum: the personal is political; naming discrimination; and empathy and community-building-it argues that they are using so-called new media for what is now problematically believed to be old (feminist) politics. © 2011 Feminist Review.","blogging; blogosphere; new media; popular feminism; single women",,"Taylor, A.; Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies, University of QueenslandAustralia",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

While these films differ at the levels of genre and style as well as in terms of their production contexts, they each feature several scenes that engage the tension between distance and proximity, separation and unity-an always unresolved tension integral to the reproductive sphere. Each film also provides at least one close-up shot of a mother's hands preparing food for her charge. Tracing Mary Ann Doane's explication of the close-up shot's engagement with the capitalist logic of the microcosm and macrocosm, I will show how the aforementioned films resignify what Doane identifies as the close-up's compensation for the loss of unity in modernity. The recurring image of a mother's labouring hands interrogates the false unity of the capitalist macrocosm, while also complicating the purportedly separate microcosm in which modern subject can touch and hold a given commodity. These films show that transnational mothers are simultaneously held within the immobile space of reproduction-owned and exploited by the larger structures that depend on their labour-while also actively recreating the cultures that render them invisible. © 2011 Feminist Review.","abject; cinema; motherhood; reproduction; transnational",,"Palmer, L.; University of California at Santa BarbaraUnited States",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

I argue that this model oversimplifies a much more complex set of relationships, leading scholars to underplay the possibilities for female agency within the built environment of the Classical city (polis) and to underestimate the scope of women's activities within Greek society more generally. Taking Athens as an example, I suggest that space was not rigidly divided between 'public' and 'private' zones. Instead, a number of factors led to flexibility which enabled a woman to enter civic space in order to carry out a variety of activities on her own behalf, on behalf of her household and also as a representative of her household in the context of the wider community. The civic context was thus an inverse parallel for the domestic sphere which, although constructed as female, was clearly also an important arena for male activity. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Classic period; cultural history; gender identity; gender relations; gender role; historical geography; historical perspective; urban area; urban society; womens status; Greece","Nevett, L.C.; Department of Classical Studies, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82555191189

This paper addresses ways in which the three foundations collaborated and co-ordinated with each other and with the city. While gender segregated these communities, both liturgy and the urban context integrated them, as can be seen from the books used and produced by religious men and women in this city in later Anglo-Saxon England. The importance of prayer to the inhabitants of the city and the wider locale can be seen in the documents that request liturgical services - most often prayers and masses - in return for grants of land and other gifts. Ecclesiastical and lay individuals alike allied themselves to these religious houses, seeking commemoration and often also burial in their cemeteries and hoping to benefit spiritually from their prayers. The ways in which gender affected the religious experiences of Winchester's citizens and their consecrated brothers and sisters are complex, but they are also important in understanding how the saints and their servants on earth related to God, to each other and to the surrounding urban space. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"cultural history; cultural influence; cultural tradition; gender issue; historical geography; historical perspective; Medieval; religion; urban society; England; Hampshire; United Kingdom; Winchester","Foxhall Forbes, H.; Trinity CollegeUnited Kingdom",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82555180525

By examining the types of social networks in which women were involved, how they were used and their impact on social relations, it argues that historians should broaden their conception of women's contribution to the Greek civic environment. Such an approach shows how women negotiated social and economic status within the polis community, how they used their social capital as a resource for social and civic engagement and sheds light on their personal relationships. These relationships not only enhanced women's well-being and allowed them to determine their own roles in community life, but also formed the basis of their engagement with the polis. Considering the social networks to which women belonged, and the differing types of social capital embedded in them, further enables an examination of female friendship.

This reciprocity of goodwill was gendered, not only in the establishment of priestesses, but in the nature of the honours given; for example Iasos celebrated Laodike III's birthday with a procession of a maiden priestess and couples who were about to wed (I.Iasos 4, II), and the people of Teos dedicated a fountain in their city centre to Laodike and required that all brides should draw from it the water for their baths (SEG 41, 1003).

The extraordinary gender relations of the entertainment district were specific to its socio-historical environment, where courtesans, although still highly dependent on men, partook in the public scene and exceeded some gender stereotypes and Confucian values, as they owned material goods and enjoyed higher physical mobility than their female counterparts in the gentry. The geographical space shared by courtesans and literati was principally a social and intellectual space, where they generated cultural productions and established social practices.

Yet, beyond the obvious need for verbal communication, for which subtitles are necessary but insufficient, the film presents other reasons for extending the concept of translation. The knot of potential confusion and the need for 'translation' are the ontological uncertainties surrounding 'madness' itself. The key questions are: are people mad? Do they perform madness, or do others perceive them as mad because they are too dissimilar from them to be accepted as 'normal'? This fundamental uncertainty affects all forms of alterity.

They are thus compelled to assign sex to genderless forms in the source text. Patriarchal translation has a long tradition of devaluing and excluding the feminine in this process, as the author demonstrates here by revealing how Jorge Luis Borges translated the pronouns you and we in Woolf's essay.

The research study on which this article is based takes an intersectional approach to explore insider accounts of the place of language speaking in individuals' constructions of self, family relationships and the wider context. Twenty-four research interviews and five published autobiographies were analysed using grounded theory, narrative and discursive analysis. A major finding was that learning a new language inducted individuals into somewhat 'stereotyped' gendered discourses and power relations within the new language, while also enabling them to view themselves differently in the context of their first language. This embodied process could be challenging and often required reflection and discursive work to negotiate the dissimilarities, discontinuities and contradictions between languages and cultures. However, the participants generally claimed that their linguistic multiplicity generated creativity. Women and men used their language differences differently to 'perform their gender'. This was particularly evident in language use within families, which involved gendered differences in the choice of language for parenting - despite the fact that both men and women experience their first languages as conveying intimacy in their relationships with their children. The article argues that the notion of 'mother tongue' (rather than 'first language') is unhelpful in this process as well as in considering the implications of living in several languages for systemic therapy. © The Author(s) 2011.","bilingualism; gender; identities; parenting; performativity; systemic therapy",,"Burck, C.; Tavistock Clinic, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, 120 Belsize Lane, London NW3 5BA, United Kingdom; email: CBurck@tavi-port.nhs.uk",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Importantly, the groups compared here were not significantly different in age, body mass index, socioeconomic status, or whether they had previously sought advice about their weight. Contrary to predictions based on previous research, there were no significant differences between the groups on eating disorder symptomatology, role concern, or social comparison measures. However, students who had previously attended single sex schools endorsed significantly thinner figure preferences overall, suggesting that school environment was an important cultural factor in the development of aspiration towards a thin idea. Additionally, both groups perceived their current figure to be larger than the figure they perceived as most attractive. Our findings provide mixed support for the notion that high school gender composition impacted on the eating-related behaviour and attitudes of university students.

However, the mechanisms through which single-sex programs increase women's engagement in STEM fields are unclear. Drawing from research in social and health psychology, we examined two theoretically-guided predictors of women's sense of belonging in their STEM majors and belonging at the university: perceived identity compatibility between being a woman and being in a STEM field, and perceived social support. Participants were 65 racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse women enrolled in a single-sex STEM program at a co-educational university in Northeastern United States. Participants completed online surveys before the start of their first year of college, and again at the beginning of their second year of college. Findings from multiple regression analyses support hypotheses that across STEM women's first or transitional year of college, perceived identity compatibility, perceived support from close others, and perceived support from the single-sex program for STEM women were each independently associated with greater sense of belonging in their major. Additionally, perceived identity compatibility and perceived support from the single-sex program were associated with greater sense of belonging at the university. These findings suggest that perceived support from sources such as single-sex programs and perceived compatibility between one's field and being female may sustain women pursuing training in nontraditional fields such as STEM. Continued investigation of these factors may elucidate the impact of single-sex programs and inform interventions to increase the retention of women in STEM. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender disparities; Identity compatibility; Science; Single-sex programs; Social support; Women",,"Rosenthal, L.; Department of Psychology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook 11794-2500 NY, United States; email: lirosenthal@notes.cc.sunysb.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053948125

However, the medical community has responded with expressed anxiety about the implications of these changes for medical professionalism and the quality of patient care. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/ approach: Drawing on literature on nostalgia, gender, identity and organisations, the paper explores the narratives of 20 senior NHS hospital doctors to identify ways in which doctors use nostalgia to react to organisational and professional challenges and resist modernisation and feminisation of medicine. Findings: This paper illustrates how senior hospital doctors' nostalgic discourses of temporal commitment may be used to constitute a highly esteemed professional identity, creating a sense of personal and occupational uniqueness for senior hospital doctors, intertwined with gendered forms of othering and exclusionary practices. Practical implications - Nostalgia at first sight appears to be an innocuous social construct. However, this study illustrates the significance of nostalgia as a subversive practice of resistance with implications for women's career and identity experiences. Change initiatives that seek to tackle resistance need also to address discourses of nostalgia in the medical profession. Originality/value: The main contribution of this study is that we illustrate how supposedly neutral discourses of nostalgia may sometimes be mobilised as devices of resistance. This study questions simplistic focus on numerical representation, such as feminisation, as indicative of modernisation and highlights the significance of exploring discourses and head counts for understanding resistance to modernisation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","All hours training; Gendered othering; Hospital medicine; Modern doctor; Nostalgia; Resistance; United Kingdom",,"Tsouroufli, M.; University of York, York, United Kingdom; email: maria.tsouroufli@york.ac.uk",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

The dynamics of policy development are investigated, a tangible effect of the shift from unofficial pragmatic multiculturalism towards community cohesion/""Britishness"" having been a government focus on English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) rather than translation/interpreting. This change has revealed a tension between the demands of identity and equality for minority ethnic people: respect for cultural identity requires provision of translation/interpreting while creating (political) equality between majority and minority communities entails the latter having access to the political language so placing an emphasis on ESOL. Design/methodology/approach - An evidence synthesis is undertaken of policy documents relating to the British state's provision of language support services and data on the skill levels in English from government surveys. Findings - The relative contribution of financial constraints and new policy/ideological positions to changes in the direction of policy and provision is assessed. With respect to the ""new approach to ESOL"", this process of discretionary allocation that privileges policies of integration and community cohesion rather than language need itself is viewed against the inadequacies of the data currently available on levels of English language proficiency in providing the basis for making policy decisions and allocating resources. Originality/value - The level of English language skills amongst Britain's minority ethnic groups and of government policy to address skill deficits has been substantially neglected.

The purpose of this paper is to test social perceptions that older workers' cognitive performance and job attitudes compare adversely to their younger colleagues. Design/methodology/approach - The research assessed samples of older and younger workers in objective tests of cognitive abilities and subjective job attitudes. An opportunity sampling method was employed to recruit a heterogeneous group of participants in Australia (n = 172). Findings - No significant differences in cognitive ability between the groups were identified; older workers were as cognitively skilled for their job as their younger colleagues. No significant group difference for perceptions of social support, job commitment, job satisfaction or turnover intentions was identified. Research limitations/implications - The cross-sectional research design adopted by this research prevented a more detailed examination of the data in terms of causal relationships. While the cognitive testing provided objective rather than subjective data and, therefore, is not as susceptible to response biases such as common method variance, the small sample who undertook the cognitive testing is acknowledged as a research limitation.

Examining the factors that have an impact on the way individuals perceive the gender pay gap helps answering the question of why it persists and how to overcome it. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a conceptual model of the factors proposed to influence individuals' perceptions of the gender pay gap by adopting social comparison, equity, occupational socialization, relative deprivation, expectancy and social dominance theories as well gender socialization perspective. Findings: According to the conceptual framework, such individual factors as pay expectations, gender role orientation, perceived pay fairness, gender, age, marital status and education facilitate the perceived gender pay gap. Furthermore, gender composition of employment sector and occupational status predict individuals' perceptions of the gender pay gap. Finally, welfare state regime and the degree of public awareness constitute the perceived gender pay gap.

Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) disease should be considered beyond the scope of health as a social issue. However, the main purpose of the study is to determine the influence of information levels on HIV/AIDS on attitudes and views towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in work life. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess this influence by means of a pilot study. Additionally, one of the basic assumptions of the study is that career and identity developments of PLHIV will be positive as a result of the increase in knowledge amongst human resource (HR) managers and career counselors about HIV and PLHIV. Design/methodology/ approach: Disinformation about HIV/AIDS may cause stigmatization and discrimination. Thus, this paper seeks to indicate the effects and results of the discrimination and tries to create awareness. Consequently, discrimination against PLHIV in work life is emphasized in the study in parallel with the information levels related to the disease. Additionally, survey technique is used on the sample of HR employees and managers who are members of The Association of HR Managers (PERYON). Findings: The paper finds that 50 percent of the respondents stated that it was right to request a HIV test whereas 36 percent of them declared that it was not right. The respondents' information level about the transmission of HIV was evaluated as medium or high. Respondents mostly think that HIV is not a punishment to people for their misbehaviors, and that sufferers should not be ashamed of themselves; PLHIV are not guilty and do not have marginal life styles. They also showed sensitivity towards the right for treatment and protection of the human rights of PLHIV. The majority of respondents stated that they could work in the same workplace with PLHIV and also that they did not associate HIV with homosexuals. Research limitations/implications - As a limitation, there is a possibility that social desirability had an effect on some of the respondents' answers. Second, the respondents have never met PLHIV in their workplaces. Because of these limitations it was not possible to get answers regarding discriminative behaviors in the workplace towards PLHIV in terms of HR functions. Thus, it is suggested that a study on PLHIV or people who work with PLHIV should be conducted. Additionally, the study could be replicated with different and larger samples. Originality/value: A contribution to increasing awareness and the cautions against discrimination towards HIV/AIDS is one of the values of this study. Another distinctive characteristic of this study is the investigation of this issue from the context of an emerging country, Turkey. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Discrimination; Diversity; HIV/Acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Homosexuality; PLHIV; Workplace",,"Surgevil, O.; Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey; email: olca.surgevil@deu.edu.tr",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper assesses publicly available data on the demographics of US MSE programs to explore expectations of correlation between increased gender diversity at the graduate level and among faculty versus undergraduate gender diversity. Findings - The number and percentage of women increased substantially in graduate programs and within faculties whereas the percentage of women receiving bachelor's of science degrees in engineering (BSE) in MSE, and nearly all other engineering disciplines, was significantly lower in 2009 than in 2000. Diversity advances at graduate, postdoctoral and faculty levels in the interdisciplinary field of MSE, and likely other relatively young engineering disciplines, have been achieved via a continuous migration of individuals from other science and engineering disciplines as well as from international science and engineering programs.

When evidence for a ""leaky pipeline"" is found within one generalized context (i.e. engineering), the assumption has been that every discipline (i.e. MSE, biomedical engineering) within that context has leaky pipelines that must be fixed. Given the present data, such assumptions may be inappropriate and perpetuate an understanding of how to improve gender diversity that is not helpful and, in fact, may be harmful to achieving diversity.

However, the scene of equality in China has changed tremendously since the 1980s. This paper aims at facilitating a specific historical understanding of the issue of women's political participation in China and asks questions such as why the theory of men and women's equality during the 1980s appeared to be questioned? What were the key challenges before this theory and practice? Why was there a theoretical shift during the 1990s? Taking the issue of women's political participation in China as an example, we can see that the road of women's liberation has been a zigzag one and the theories and practice of gender equality have been ambiguous. My argument is that we should look for something beyond numbers and percentages when, for example, analyzing the issues of women's political participation. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Chinese women; Gender equality; Globalization; Men-women's equality; Socialism; Women' political participation",,"Min, D.",,,12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

Special attention is given to Sarojini Naidu, a poetess and nationalist. Indian women, in particular Naidu, were focused upon during this period. These were strong and proactive women who brought about change in society, a view that was politically motivated. By describing Indian women in a positive manner, the Korean media obliquely sought to criticize their own oppressive colonizers. Just as the image of Indian women as passive victims had been partly used to rationalize British colonial intervention, the representation of strong Indian women helped the Koreans indirectly to critique colonial control. This Korean perception, however, did not imply a progressive or liberal trend. Despite the positive interpretations of strong Indian women and the efforts made to present gender role models portraying Indian women as energetic to their Korean counterparts, the underlying attitudes in all such reports and comments were extremely patriarchal in that they focused on women with authentic and proven femininity. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Colonialism; India; Indian women; Korea; Patriarchal nationalism; Sarojini naidu",,"Lee, O.",,,12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

Written as an imitation of Cao Xueqin's masterpiece and a reversal of Wen Kang's novel (itself also a rewriting of Cao Xueqin's work), Lanhua meng qizhuan consciously returns to the tragic mode of representation while it re-polarizes the themes of heroism and love (or ritualized morality versus private feeling) in its portrayal of the married life of a female hero, Song Baozhu. Through the deterioration of the heroine's marriage and her death, the novel exposes the deep-seated male centeredness in Chinese society and culture. At the same time, it reveals the ideological and artistic clashes of the hero-lover model promoted by Wen Kang and undermines his effort of assimilating qing (love, feelings) into the domain of public morality. The author's effort in Lanhua meng qizhuan, while seriously tackling the social problem of gender inequality in its time, also challenged old conventions and opened new avenues in Chinese fiction. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","gender confl ict; heroism and love; Late Qing literature; tragic mode",,"Wang, Y.; Mount Holyoke CollegeUnited States; email: yingwang@mtholyoke.edu",,,13876805,,,,"English","NAN NU",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053933006

It analyzes archaeological reports on women's and men's tombs in Song Fujian as well as relevant writings by Song era Neo-Confucian scholars. Despite Neo-Confucians' strong emphasis on gender segregation among the living, both textual and material evidence show that the increasingly hardened gender hierarchy did not carry over into the afterlife. Prescription of gender distinctions in burial practices is virtually absent from neo-Confucians' writings. The structure of tombs implies that communication between women and men after death was expected, not suppressed. Similarities overwhelm differences among women's and men's grave goods, which resemble each other in both object categories and decorative motifs.

Design/methodology/approach – The sample consisted of 200 MSMEs. Analysis is based, first, on factor analysis to extract important factors and, second, multiple linear regression is used to empirically validate the feminist theories by examining the mediation effects and moderation effects regarding gender of entrepreneurs. Findings – The findings showed that not all feminist-related factors mediate the relationship between gender and non-economic performance whereas the gender of entrepreneurs moderates personal, social network, and skills factors and non-economic performance but not family factor. Lastly, the compilation of the mediation and moderation results revealed that SFT is more applicable than LFT to Lao MSMEs. Research limitations/implications – This research had some limitations such as the lack of empirical literature supporting non-economic performance indicators. Therefore, the findings should not be generalized. Practical implications – This research provided implications for policymakers, implementers, and academics. The results showed that it is necessary to support female entrepreneurs in terms of the use of personal, social, and skills factors to improve non-economic performance. However, it is not necessary to support family factor in improving endowments and changing their use. Governments must mitigate the gender gap at macro levels through the elimination of gender discrimination, such as in education, banking practice, and the workplace, to increase the long-term confidence of females in society. Originality/value – The unique contribution of the study is to prove the applicability of SFT and LFT by quantitative analytical methodologies with focusing on non-economic firm performance. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","China; Entrepreneurialism; Family factor; Liberal feminist theory; Non-economic performance; Personal factor; Skills factor; Social factor; Social feminist theory; Women",,,,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053312530

The noncompliant patients achieved equally good results as the compliant ones, and did so in a shorter time. A good treatment outcome could be achieved even when the patient had told the assessing psychiatrist a falsified story of his life and sought hormone therapy, genital surgery, or legal sex reassignment on his own initiative without a recommendation from the psychiatrist.

Sixty percent of the young women reported that they masturbate. Results from the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicate that the participants in the older age group (22 to 25 years old) were more likely to report masturbation (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.92, p <01) compared with their younger counterparts. Pornography use was positively associated with masturbation (AOR = 5.92, p <001) while attendance of religious services was associated with lower odds of reporting masturbation (AOR = 0.42-0.41, p <05).

Increased wife's education was associated with decreased husband's extramarital sex. Men living in rural areas and in the Central and Southern regions were also more likely to have extramarital sex. The findings suggest useful implications for HIV prevention programs in Nigeria.

The aim of the study was to determine the incidence of patients with a sexual dysfunction, associated health problems, and related interventions performed by their general practitioners (GPs). The study design was a dynamic cohort study comparing 6 years of data on patients with a sexual dysfunction. Participating GPs were asked to record weekly all consulting patients who presented with a sexual dysfunction. In an additional questionnaire, these problems and associated interventions were specified. Incidence of sexual dysfunctions varied between 132 per 100,000 per year for male patients and 60 per 100,000 per year for female patients. Men mainly consulted a GP for erectile dysfunction, and women mainly consulted a GP for hypoactive sexual desire disorder and dyspareunia. Sexual desire problems were more often associated with comorbid problems such as psychological and relationship problems and medication use than other sexual dysfunctions. Female patients showed more co-occurrence of sexual dysfunction and were more often referred to secondary care services than were male patients. During the period of 2003 to 2008, the help-seeking pattern of men and women consulting their GP for a sexual dysfunction appears to be stable. The presence of comorbid problems indicates that GPs are often dealing with complex multifactorial dynamics. Co-occurrence of sexual dysfunction among women probably resulted in a higher referral rate to secondary care services. Therefore, a gender-sensitive approach and an open mind to differences in sexual identity are needed for counseling in and treatment of sexual dysfunction. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","comorbidity; general practice; incidence; Sexual dysfunction; The Netherlands",,"Kedde, H.; Rutgers WPF, P.

Using a grounded theory framework, I found that the most important determinant of partner inclusion in this decision was relationship status. More specifically, if the respondent was in a longer-term dating relationship at the time of the incident, she was more likely to involve her partner in the decision-making process compared with those respondents in casual relationships. The reason for being at risk for pregnancy (e.g., a broken condom vs. a missed birth control pill) also influenced partner inclusion. And finally, I found that often it was the men who initiated the conversation about obtaining EC originally. Overall, this research demonstrates that men do indeed have a part to play in EC decision making and need to be included in future research. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Contraception; qualitative studies; sex and gender roles; unintended pregnancy",,"Daugherty, J.

It remains unclear whether the paroxysmal disorder seen in infants who have yet to develop self-awareness or ideas about sex is equivalent to the masturbatory orgasm seen later on in childhood, when the patient has a clear self-awareness and sexual interest. This article details a case that may answer this question. Paroxysmal disorder was initially observed in a female patient at an age of 5 months. It presented regularly throughout her infancy and childhood, up age 8 years. She described the sensations that she experienced during episodes as pleasant as early as age 3 years. In a clinical interview, she confirmed that she experienced pleasure with the rhythmic contractions of her vagina, suggestive of episodes of masturbatory orgasm. This suggests that the paroxysmal disorder seen in infancy is most likely similar to the masturbatory orgasm seen in childhood. The scientific and clinical meaning of early paroxysmal disorder in sexual medicine is discussed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","infantile masturbation; orgasm; Paroxysmal disorder; self-awareness",,"Zhu, B.-g.; Department of Psychiatry, The 10th People's Hospital affiliated to Tongji University, 1239 Siping Road, Shanghai 200092, China; email: binggen.zhu@tongji.edu.cn",,,19317611,,,,"English","Int.

A total of 345 interactions were coded by sexual orientation salience (no, yes) and setting (private, public, organizational). Roughly half of the interactions (N = 156, 45%) were those in which parents said that their sexual orientation did not matter; nonsalience was more likely to occur in private or organizational settings rather than public. Regarding salience, parents described a slightly higher proportion of interactions in which their sexual orientation did matter (N = 189, 55%). Of these, salience was most likely to occur in organizational settings rather than public or private. Parents most commonly described salience that occurred in organizational settings as negative rather than positive. Regarding desired resources, parents prioritized support and socialization for their children rather than for themselves, but they desired resources that clearly identified their children as having GLBTQ parents (i.e., resources where parental sexual orientation was salient). These findings suggest a strong recommendation for improving organizational policies related to education, health care, employment, and family services so that GLBTQ parents and their children are openly acknowledged by staff without negative overtones. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","GLBTQ issues; identity salience; qualitative research; rural families",,"Oswald, R.

Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS; 1991-2006), this study estimates time use in three sectors (farm, off-farm, and domestic) and analyzes the contribution of four features of economic development to changes in time use. Women's share of paid and unpaid work has increased in both the farm and off-farm sectors, and migration is a critical determinant. Economic development is associated with a rise in absolute work time, although not an increase in the time-use gender gap. Measuring the feminization of labor with time use rather than labor force participation data may be relevant to feminist analyses in other regions and countries, since it enables a more nuanced evaluation of the impacts of economic development on changes in the well-being of women. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","China; economic development; gender; time use",,"Chang, H.; School of Management, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xianning West 28#, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710049, China; email: changhongqin@yahoo.com.cn",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

However, low wages and insufficient employer-based benefits often leave employed single mothers with inadequate material resources to support families and less time to care for their children. The lack of consideration given to the value of poor women's time in both the administration and benefit levels of antipoverty government support, as well as the measures used to calculate poverty, place more binds on poor and low-income mothers' time.

Bernard of Angers, in the Liber miraculorum, portrays Foy as a trickster tomboy whose miracles are known as her ""jokes.""

Her male-headed reliquary further affirms her identity as a holy warrior of Christ who fights to uphold the Peace of God.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors estimate a two-stage least squares regression using data on 679 CEO successions in North American firms. Findings: The results show that successor CEOs are more likely to be female the greater the percentage of females on the board, regardless of other succession characteristics such as whether the new CEO is from inside or outside the firm. Furthermore, a change in CEO from male to female is associated with a decrease in several measures of firm risk taking. Research limitations/implications: The sample is restricted to relatively large, exchange-traded North American firms and may not generalize to other groups. Practical implications: The findings suggest that women aspiring to CEO positions and firms wishing to promote women should monitor board composition to ensure female representation. Other steps that the firm may take to promote women to this position (such as looking outside the firm) have an insignificant impact when board composition is taken into account. Originality/value: The findings are novel and inform CEO succession research by demonstrating which succession process characteristics work to increase females' chances and which have no effect.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a performance-adjusted discretionary accrual model to examine the association between gender variables and the firm's earnings management. Regression analysis is applied using 320 firms from the S&P Small Cap 600. Findings: The authors find consistent evidence to show that the presence of a female director on the audit committee constrains earnings management by increasing negative (income-decreasing) discretionary accruals. Research limitations/implications: Future research can explore the behavior of female managers by applying the gender theory. Furthermore, the paper's evidence has implications for regulators and policy makers, since the presence of a female director in the audit committee may affect management decisions and audit quality in a positive way. Therefore, gender diversity on the board should be more strongly emphasized. Moreover, the presence of female members on the board may further enhance public confidence. Originality/value: This research contributes to the existing literature on gender in four aspects. First, this research provides new evidence to reinforce the existing gender literature that women are more risk averse, cautious and ethical than men. Second, the findings showcase that gender theory can be applied into the research of management behavior.

Design/methodology/approach: The specific research question is how gender, social interaction, team psychological safety and synergistic knowledge development influence certain characteristics - complexity and centrality - of an individual's mental model of firm strategies. A survey was conducted on a sample of US business students enrolled in strategic management courses. Social interaction, team psychological safety and synergistic knowledge development were measured by use of multiple-item seven-point Likert scales. Mental models were constructed by the causal mapping method. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: The regression analyses of the survey data support most of the hypotheses. Gender directly influences complexity and centrality in mental models of firm strategies and moderates the predictive influence of social interaction on synergistic knowledge development. Research limitations/implications: Possible limitations are the use of a student sample and of respondents as the sole data source. Future research could use managers as research subjects and multiple data sources and explore other determinants of the mental model of firm strategies. Practical implications: The findings alert university educators about the importance of helping women develop high-order knowledge and problem-solving skills by understanding various business functions and synthesizing diverse perspectives. Corporate managers need to design and implement special mentoring and training programs for women with the aim of enriching their specific management knowledge. This study also suggests that women may increase their chance of developing strategic knowledge by proactively networking with senior managers. Originality/value: This study on gender differences in accumulating management knowledge and skills helps us better understand the roots of and solutions to the gender gap in management and leadership positions. The most intriguing result is the demonstration of gender differences in the development of specific management knowledge.

We assessed the experiences of 197 college football players who operate in this "" masculinized"" context (e.g., Richman & Shaffer, 2000) where muscularity is viewed functionally (i.e., maximizing athletic performance, minimizing injuries). Quantitative results indicated that athletic identity and certain traditional masculine norms (i.e., risk taking, emotional control, primacy of work) were significantly related to the drive for muscularity among college football players. Qualitative results indicated that football players primarily cited reasons for their desire to be muscular that were related to athletic functioning, while also acknowledging social benefits of external gratification (e.g., physical appearance, conformity, sex appeal) that are more prominent in the drive for muscularity literature.

By defining domestic cooking as a feminine task, Palestinian men strengthen their domination over women. Conversely, in the public sphere, men use cooking as a means of breadwinning. Their cooking intertwines with issues of identity formation and relations of domination. As restaurateurs, Palestinian men refrain from serving domestic dishes. Thus, they show respect to Palestinian women and simultaneously preserve the traditional distinctions between home food and restaurant food. They view their upholding of their culinary knowledge as a major contribution to the limited appropriation of Palestinian food into the popular Jewish culinary repertoire.

Older men frequently expected youthful promiscuity to give way to a family-focused older age and saw decreasing erectile function as a ""natural"" embodiment of this shift. Conversely, younger men who strove to be different than their once-womanizing fathers often saw decreased erectile function as a relationship-threatening medical problem appropriate for erectile dysfunction (ED) treatment. Despite the fact that ED drugs may facilitate sexual penetration that could be associated with ""macho"" sexuality, they were viewed most positively by younger study participants seeking to avoid machismo by pursuing affective marital sex. © The Author(s) 2011.","aging; erectile dysfunction; machismo; masculinity; Mexico",,"Wentzell, E.; University of Iowa, 114 MacBride Hall, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States; email: emily-wentzell@uiowa.edu",,,1097184X,,,,"English","Men Masculin.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052501668

The study employed semistructured focus groups and interviews with thirty-two participants from two locations in a large urban Canadian city. It is argued that young men are confronted with competing discourses of masculinity where they are simultaneously incited to work on and transform their bodies into culturally recognizable ideals, while at the same time remaining distant and aloof to the size, shape, and appearance of their bodies. Resolving this double-bind of masculinity, it is argued, remains a central task of reproducing the privileges of masculinity.

The author then proceeds to update her research by examining the climate of opinion toward variant homosexualities in selected African countries, including South Africa. She mentions specific cases of homophobia in Malawi and Uganda, a gap between the progressive provisions of the South African Bill of Rights that guarantee human rights in terms of sexuality, and a reluctance on the part of the South African government to raise this issue with other African Union states. The author also highlights the role of activist organizations in Malawi, Uganda and South Africa. She then turns to an analysis of cultural productions in South Africa, beginning with a discussion of homophobia in Spud: The Movie. After a brief overview of her book, Somewhere in the Double Rainbow: Representations of Bisexuality in Post-Apartheid Novels, published in 2007, the author examines a number of more recent authors' treatments of bisexuality. She argues that Damon Galgut's In a Strange Room: Three Journeys portrays bisexual characters in terms of stereotypes; however, other novels, by authors across a range of subject positions, are more open and accepting of sexual fluidity.

Advocating for sociological approaches and the analytic inclusion of nonbisexual identified but behaviorally bisexual individuals, the author suggests that more empirical attention to material relations, social structures and everyday social interactions is needed to complement the symbolic emphasis of queer theory and cultural studies. Further incorporating analytical attention to non-bisexual-identified individuals would better ground bisexuality studies and would involve a redirection of critical attention to the multiple social processes that generate bisexual 'absences.'

The article concludes with quotes from a few of the author's favorite passages. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual invisibility; bisexual periodicals; bisexuality; Fritz Klein; GLBTQ media; Haworth Press; Journal of Bisexuality; Pete Chvany; Ron Suresha; Taylor & Francis",,"Suresha, R.

It is also a reflection on that experience. What there is to learn from it in terms of creating a culture of research on bisexuality that empowers people to live authentic lives-and fulfill Fritz Klein's promise of a healthy bisexuality whose gift to the world is the joy of 100% intimacy. The article is made of an introduction to the four issues, on women and bisexuality in a global perspective, on polyamory and bisexuality, on bisexuality and queer theory and on community-related research on bisexuality that gives off the effect of a bi utopia, or bitopia. It discusses the Fritz Klein intellectual legacy and what it means in terms of understanding the role of bisexuality in today's world and its potential to contribute to a paradigm shift toward an epistemology based on love for love, or erotophilia. It discusses in depth the circumstances under which the 'miracle' of '10 years of bisexuality' has been possible in a decade of planetary disarray and human distress. And it gives special attention to the circumstances in which the four issues came into being. The article further samples significant contributions to the issues, including those by Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli, Betty Dodson and Deborah Anapol, all of whom are pioneers and leaders in the sex-positive movement. Finally, the article also positions the author as a scholar activist whose method of criticism can be termed 'holistic' because it integrates correlated approaches synergistically, including close reading and cultural theory. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","epistemology; erotophilia; erotophobia; existentialism; Fritz Klein; healthy bisexuality; holistic cultural theory; love; polyamory; Sigmund Freud; utopia; women",,"Anderlini-D'Onofrio, S.P.O.

Twenty-six couples, comprising 26 males and 26 females, completed a questionnaire and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid (KSOG). This study discovered that bisexual females and their male partners maintained a satisfactory relationship, independent of the above variables. Although males behaved mostly heterosexually, they exhibited a trend toward a bisexual orientation when they indicated their ideal choices on the KSOG. The majority of the females behaved bisexually, in agreement with their choices on the KSOG. One half of the women were maintaining sexual relationships with other women while in primary heterosexual relationships. Their average sexual contact with another female per month was 1 1/2 times. The majority of the women were satisfied with their sexual experiences with their male partner, and they were having sexual intercourse, on average, 3 times per week. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual behavior; bisexual married women; bisexual women in heterosexual relationships; couple satisfaction; Klein Sexual Orientation Grid (KSOG); nontraditional trends; purpose of study; research instruments; selection criteria; sexual behavior; sexual orientation; variables",,"Reinhardt, R.

I conclude that, while much has changed in my own life and the wider world over the last decade, there is still work to be done at the intersection of bisexuality, gender and sociology. I consider, in this regard, the impact of same-sex marriage in Canada, the legal struggle over polygamy, and the rise of transgender, queer and intersex politics. I also ponder the concept of bisexual identity in the (post)modern-day context. While a greater awareness of non-heterosexual relationships has had a positive effect, some queer people are deemed more acceptable than others. Bisexuals continue to occupy marginalized positions and misperceptions about bisexuality thrive. I am disappointed by this lack of progress but wonder if the terminology is outmoded. Perhaps a better indicator would be number of people who embrace ""queer"" and ""questioning,"" or rejecting labels altogether. I end by reviewing the texts I investigated in the original essay for information pertaining to bisexuality.

Meanwhile, evidence suggests that MSM experience barriers to accessing health care. To investigate health care disparities and health behaviors, we compared data from a diverse MSM sample (N = 871) to data from men from the National Health Interview Survey (N = 7,783). MSM reported less health care access than did general population men, and were more likely to report smoking, alcohol use, and depression. In addition, a recent health care visit mediated sample differences in smoking and depression, suggesting that health care disparities between MSM and non-MSM are associated with important health outcomes. This study is the first to examine MSM versus general population health care discrepancies using an MSM sample that is not exclusively partnered.

Leaving behind the classical southern Mediterranean stereotypical images - structured around the binary opposition between 'top' and 'bottom' sexualities - a new model has emerged where the idea of 'gayness' replaces old ways of thinking about male homosexuality. These changes have shaped both the hegemonic view of homosexuals in society and perceptions by homosexuals themselves. Slowly, Spanish homosexuals have created new narratives dissociated from strategies of adaptation to the homophobic contexts of the Francoist regime. Spanish homosexuals no longer mechanically reproduce social prejudices about male homosexuality. They have also developed new frameworks to think about themselves.

Results demonstrate that for both schools the friendship network is not associated with academic achievement, though boys with similar levels of academic application cluster together. However, for the influence network there are effects related to achievement, application and attitudes toward an antiacademic/ masculinity connection, as too toward ethno-cultural background.

Analysis shows that being a boy was closely linked to certain qualities that every boy had to perfect. Boys' strivings to attain these qualities was the source of gender-based violence. Boys' failure to attain these qualities was the source of anguish and embarrassment for them.

This panic, which has been criticised by feminists as a backlash and a form of recuperative politics, has promoted the development of research into gender and education, particularly studies related to the gendered culture of primary schools and on the masculinities of male teachers. However, male primary principals remain relatively under-researched in the literature, despite the importance of their structural position and increasing concern over the masculinisation of school leadership. This paper aims to contribute to the discussion by critically analysing the interpretive frameworks of 12 male primary school principals.

Through an analysis of transcribed interviews and interview notes, seven themes emerged: (1) Looking Like a Family and Looking Alike; (2) Mothering as Vulnerability; (3) Teen Daughters' Perceptions of Black Men as Undesirable and Frightening; (4) Exposing Children to Culture; (5) Children and Mothers' Experiences as ""Other""; (6) Hostility from Black Women; and (7) Not Talking About Race.

Immigrant women are in a unique position to simultaneously encounter prejudice related to multiple aspects of social identity, such as gender, race, and ethnicity, contributing to feelings of marginalization.

Centrality (strength of identification with racial group), private regard (positive feelings about racial group), public regard (positive feelings others have about racial group), and gender moderated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem for a sample of men (n=109) and women (n=316) college students from three regions of the United States. Body dissatisfaction was related to lower self-esteem only for those African Americans for whom race was less central to their identities. High private regard and low body dissatisfaction were synergistically associated with higher self-esteem. Similarly, low public regard and high body dissatisfaction were synergistically related to lower self-esteem. There was a positive main effect for assimilation ideology (emphasis on similarities between African Americans and Western society) on self-esteem; however it was not a significant moderator.

The qualitative research framework was informed by Feminist Standpoint Theory. Participants in three focus groups responded to semi-structured questions and prompts, interspersed with viewing examples of sexualised images. Five strong thematic categories emerged: concern for the harmful impacts of sexualised images on the vulnerable, the media's portrayal of sexual content with a focus on physical appearance and youth, descriptions of the impact of viewing sexualised images, moderators of the impact of sexualised images on well-being, and marginalisation of women in the media. Findings from this research indicate that sexualised images in the media do have an impact on older women's self image and mental health in numerous ways and in a range of situations. Emotional impacts included sadness, anger, concern, envy, desensitisation, marginalisation, and discomfort that their appearance was being judged by others. A strong sense of self apart from appearance, feeling valued by family and community, ignoring or overlooking media content, and being aware that media images are not real and attainable helped buffer the link between sexualised images and well-being. Another important finding is that the impact is variable: women may experience different responses to similar sexualised content depending on a range of social, health and lifestyle factors affecting them at any given time. © 2011 The Author(s).","Body image; Feminist standpoint theory; Mental health; Older women; Self-objectification; Sexualised images",,"Hine, R.; La Trobe University, 6 Cardigan Street, Kirkstall, VIC 3283, Australia; email: rocki8@bigpond.com",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053563761

In Western cultures, these standards are both concentrated and ubiquitous in the media, represented as gendered body ideals for citizens to aspire toward. Because gendered body ideals are revered, individuals try to construct and portray their body consistently with these ideals. Furthermore, because gendered body ideals are narrowly defined and restrictive, individuals constrict their behavior, relationships, and perceptions of themselves and others to fall within the parameters of these ideals. The third and final issue of this series showcases innovative studies within two streams. The first stream investigates the many ways individuals invest effort into constructing and/or portraying their body to fit the gendered body ideal. The second stream addresses the diverse ways internalization of these ideals constrict individuals' relationships, freedoms, and perceptions of others' bodies and lifestyles. We discuss the empirical articles alongside points raised in films by Jhally (2009) and Clark (2009) that emphasize how media portrayals of gendered body ideals foster body-related constructions and constrictions in viewers. We emphasize intersectionality when presenting the articles, recognizing that gender combines with multiple identities (e. g., sexual orientation, race, political affiliation, and age) as well as individual difference variables to mold the degree to which individuals construct and constrict themselves and others to fit gendered body ideals. We end with a discussion of how these articles can be used to generate social change by deconstructing and delegitimizing gendered body ideals. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body image; Gendered body constrictions; Gendered body constructions; Gendered body ideals; Intersectionality; Prevention; Sexual orientation; Social change strategies; Treatment",,"Tylka, T.

The sample of men (N=220) were from a mid-sized university in Ontario, Canada and ranged in age from 17.92 through 29.25 years. The men reported their height and completed scales measuring masculine, gender-related characteristics (Agency, Unmitigated Agency, gender-typed Occupational Preferences and Conformity to Male Norms). An experimenter also measured the men's height using a standardized scale. As expected, the men over-reported their height. Shorter men exaggerated their height more than taller men. Also, as expected, a linear regression analysis revealed that certain masculine, gender-related characteristics (Unmitigated Agency and Occupational Preferences) predicted an over-reporting of height. These results suggest that men higher in some stereotypically masculine gender role characteristics have an elevated need to achieve socially desirable masculine physical characteristics, and do so to such a degree that they are prone to distorting this important aspect of their body size.

Ninety-three undergraduate women from a large public Midwestern university in the United States completed questionnaires assessing the nature, frequency, and consequences of appearance focused social comparisons. Compared to no comparison, media comparisons were associated with greater body checking, negative affect, and guilt; peer comparisons were associated with greater body checking and guilt. Cognitive distortions moderated the relationship between appearance focused social comparisons and body checking. Specifically, the relationship between peer comparisons and body checking was strengthened at higher levels of appearance focused cognitive distortions.

In contrast, pregnancy may be a time that women are more attuned to their body's functionality. Extending objectification theory, we investigate relationships among body surveillance, awareness and appreciation of body functionality, depressive symptoms, and prenatal health behaviors among an on-line sample of 156 predominantly White, middle-class pregnant women from throughout the U.S recruited through maternity stores, message boards, listservs, and snowballing techniques. We examine whether higher levels of awareness and appreciation of body functionality may attenuate, and thereby possibly protect women from the negative effects of high body surveillance. We found that higher body surveillance was associated with depressive symptoms and, although not significant, tended to be associated with engagement in unhealthy prenatal behaviors. Awareness and appreciation of body functionality were each associated with fewer depressive symptoms and less engagement in unhealthy prenatal behaviors. Supporting our hypotheses, we found that at higher levels of appreciation of body functionality, the relationship between body surveillance and engagement in unhealthy behaviors was attenuated. However, in contrast to our hypotheses, the relationship between body surveillance and depression was stronger at higher levels of awareness of body functionality, and attenuated at lower levels. These findings suggest appreciation of body functionality may buffer negative effects of body surveillance. Future research examining these relationships over the course of pregnancy, and among ethnically and socioeconomically diverse women, is needed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body functionality appreciation; Body functionality awareness; Pregnancy; Self-objectification",,"Rubin, L.

Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative methodological approach involves an interpretative analysis of transcribed interviews conducted in narrative style with 12 women from Swedish family businesses. Findings – By presenting entrepreneurial identity as a combination of two distinct narratives, the “passive” entrance into the family business is highlighted. The “Pippi Longstocking” narrative illustrates conscious choices, drive and motivation based on an entrepreneurial identification: the proactive plot. The “Alice in Wonderland” narrative on the other hand, illustrates women who happen to become entrepreneurs or business persons because the family business was there: the reactive plot. The contrasting and complementing narratives illustrate ambiguities in the identity process. Practical implications – The authors identified the following opportunities for women in family business: the family business can offer easy access to a career and on-the-job learning opportunities; education in other areas can be useful when learning how to manage and develop the family business; and the family business offers a generous arena for pursuing a career at different life stages. Implications for education as well as for policy makers are also presented.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the context of female entrepreneurship in Japan, and highlights the importance of “motherhood” for Japanese women. Outlining the institutional context of gender role and female entrepreneurship, and using two case studies of Japanese female entrepreneurs as illustrative examples, the paper explores how gender role identity can be viewed as a core element driving female entrepreneurship. Drawing on institutional theory and the “role as resource” perspective, a set of propositions are advanced on linkages between gender role identity and female entrepreneurship. Findings – The findings suggest that a strong identification with their family roles, in particular the role as a mother, lead Japanese women onto the entrepreneurial path. A strong gender role identity is also reflected in the identity of the ventures, the products and services provided by these ventures, and their organizational structure and practices. Research limitations/implications – This study represents an initial attempt to explore how female entrepreneurs can leverage their gender role identity in creating a unique configuration for their ventures that represents a fit to their identity as mothers. Originality/value – Instead of viewing gender role identity one-sidedly as a constraint, the case-study-based conceptual arguments advanced are employed to develop a more balanced perspective on motherhood as being an enabling factor in female entrepreneurship. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Family roles; Gender theory; Japan; National culture; Women; Women's entrepreneurship",,"Leung, A.; University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

The authors specifically examine the role of specific and general human capital in the opportunity identification process. A survey instrument was applied to 174 MBA students at a university in Northeastern Mexico. Findings – This study shows the significant effect of specific human capital: people with greater prior knowledge of customer needs or problems tended to identify more opportunities; however, the probability of identifying opportunities with innovation increased when individuals had been exposed to different industries through prior work and entrepreneurial experience. Gender differences were not significant for either the number of opportunities identified or the innovativeness of such opportunities.

More importantly, to investigate in what socio-economic context entrepreneurial individuals are more likely to become social than business entrepreneurs. These questions are important for policy because there has been a shift from direct to indirect delivery of many public services in the UK, requiring a professional approach to social enterprise. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence is presented from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) UK survey based upon a representative sample of around 21,000 adults aged between 16 and 64 years interviewed in 2009. The authors use logistic multivariate regression techniques to identify differences between business and social entrepreneurs in demographic characteristics, effort, aspiration, use of resources, industry choice, deprivation, and organisational structure. Findings – The results show that the odds of an early-stage entrepreneur being a social rather than a business entrepreneur are reduced if they are from an ethnic minority, if they work ten hours or more per week on the venture, and if they have a family business background; while they are increased if they have higher levels of education and if they are a settled in-migrant to their area. While women social entrepreneurs are more likely than business entrepreneurs to be women, this is due to gender-based differences in time commitment to the venture. In addition, the more deprived the community they live in, the more likely women entrepreneurs are to be social than business entrepreneurs. However, this does not hold in the most deprived areas where we argue civic society is weakest and therefore not conducive to support any form of entrepreneurial endeavour based on community engagement. Originality/value – The paper's findings suggest that women may be motivated to become social entrepreneurs by a desire to improve the socio-economic environment of the community in which they live and see social enterprise creation as an appropriate vehicle with which to address local problems. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business entrepreneurs; Business formation; Global Entreprenurship Monitor; Social entrepreneurs; United Kingdom; Women",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on data from 20 structured in-depth interviews conducted with Emirate women who had worked for a minimum of five years in IT. Findings – Although national women have made remarkable inroads into almost all professions and occupations in recent years, they are still noticeably under-represented in IT, particularly in the private sector. In addition, very few are in senior-level positions and there are, at the time of writing, no Emirate women technology-entrepreneurs. The results show that cultural and familial factors still inhibit many young Emirate women from choosing careers in this profession, and negative gendered attitudinal assumptions about women are still prevalent within the local IT sector. Research limitations/implications – The sample size was small, so we were unable to test specific research hypotheses, or compare our results with quantitative cohort surveys conducted in other countries.

It compares three works: Ross Kauffman and Zana Briski's popular documentary Born into Brothels (2004) and the artist Elahe Massumi's multichannel video installations The Hijras (2000) and A Kiss Is Not a Kiss (2000). The analysis examines how each work defines a specific site of sexual exploitation and how each defines the scale of the problem, and I articulate how the representation of women's bodies as sex workers locates them in particular economies of value (loans, indenture, and exchange) on a national and transnational level. The question of scale addresses both the chains of responsibility and relationality that produce the red-light district's activity and exploitation and the position of the intended audience, calling for charity, empathy, or accountability. Representations of prostitution specifically wrestle with the production of images that may reinforce the looks by which sex workers are eroticized and exploited. They also contend with visual regimes that (directly or indirectly) pass moral judgment on sex work generally. The article finds that Born into Brothels follows a rescue narrative whereby the children's safety is (conditionally) guaranteed by the structures of liberal citizenship, thus figuring the documentary's own role as enfranchising. It uses international rights-based language and institutions to rescue children from ""joining the line."" Massumi's multichannel videos, on the other hand, formally address the differential position of sex workers, both within the structures of transnational capitalism (exploitation) and violently shut out from them (subaltern oppression). The videos' formal experimentation acts as a device to produce in its viewers a responsiveness to, and sense of responsibility toward, its subjects even as it proposes no concrete solutions to conditions of sexual exploitation. The subjects figured are not simply victims, and yet they are still violently excluded from the privileges of citizenship and subjectivity. Massumi's artworks thus belie the more clearly drawn line between inside and outside proposed by a project like Born into Brothels. They call to account the interconnected structures (in which we as viewers also participate) that produce both the conditions of the subjects' exploitation as well as the international community's demand for redress. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",,,"Lynes, K.

Fans produce works not only for personal pleasure but also to share them, facilitate interaction, and bridge a shared imaginary. In Japan, as elsewhere, women account for the majority of this activity, but unique to Japan is the relative autonomy this group has achieved and the high visibility of their activities. The existence of overlapping spheres of virtual and physical fan activity on the present scale in Japan provides a unique opportunity to analyze emergent patterns of intimacy at a time when interactions with media and technology are playing an increasingly important role in shaping communication and friendship. My case study is a group of young women who identify as fujoshi, or ""rotten girls."" This article examines how they produce, consume, and share fiction, as well as the discussions and relationships that these practices make possible across physical and virtual space.

While transnational feminists seek to examine how racialized, gendered selves are produced within processes of globalization, this work has largely neglected international tourism, which I argue is a key contemporary site of such production. While critical tourism scholarship has explored such issues, this work has nevertheless focused on how powerful Western and neocolonial actors reproduce colonial-era notions of racial and gender difference for other Western tourists, thereby neglecting a number of dimensions, including the critical role of the state. I argue that the state addresses audiences in addition to Western tourists in the global North, including the elite Indian diaspora in the global North and elite domestic Indians. For each audience, the state constructs racial and gender difference in a particular way, perpetuating colonial-era images for some audiences, disrupting them for others, and introducing new images of racial and gender difference for still others. Ultimately, I argue that the postcolonial neoliberal state engages in a complex process of self-racialization and self-sexualization-to both Westerners and domestic Indians-that points to state-sponsored international tourism as a key site of the reproduction of and resistance to racial and gender difference in contemporary globalization. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.",,,"Patil, V.; Department of Global and Sociocultural Studies, Women's Studies Center, Florida International UniversityUnited States",,,00979740,,,,"English","Signs",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052423842

Similarly, either/or reactions also seem to be applied by people dealing professionally with issues of transsexualism, transgenderism or related statuses. For instance, the history of transsexualism is characterised by attempts to classify transsexual people hierarchically and descriptively. The primary intention was to discriminate between different types of transsexualism to prescribe hormonal and surgical treatment for 'real' transsexual people and to recommend psychotherapy aiming at relieving gender dysphoria for all the others. In this regard, from the early beginnings sexologists have argued about the origins of transsexualism, because the type of origin - the professionals assumed - legitimises a specific kind of treatment, for example psychotherapy for psychological issues and somatic cross-sex treatment for biological issues. Consequently, psychoanalysts and biologically orientated professionals have debated at great lengths about state-of-the-art treatment for transsexual people. Furthermore, to pass as a 'real' transsexual, most of the people concerned presented themselves in a very schematic way. The main focus of this article is the long-standing history of either/or reactions in health care professionals dealing with issues of transsexualism and related states. In addition, it elaborates on the iatrogenic influence on the behaviour of transsexual people of the biases of health care professionals. Finally, in highlighting perspectives of recent trans theory, conclusions important for the debate of current issues are drawn and ideas for the future of care are developed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender identity disorders; psychoanalysis; sexual binary; transgenderism; transsexualism",,"Richter-Appelt, H.; Department of Sex Research and Forensic Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; email: hrichter@uke.de",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

Being accused of being a pervert can have detrimental consequences, and although everyone involved in 'perverted' sex risks social censure, people unprotected by social advantages are more vulnerable to the discriminatory impacts of this sexual stigma than are those shielded by racial and/or class privileges. Our objectives in this article are multi-fold, and we document the affiliation between polyamory and bondage/discipline, dominance/submission and/or sadism/masochism; demonstrate through a meta-analysis of extant literature the ways in which research on alternative sexual communities has often (unwittingly) reinforced and (re)constituted a homogenous image of these non-conformist subcultures; support and augment this analysis with our own empirical data; and provide recommendations to improve research methods. By highlighting the race and class privileges that operate throughout these processes, we aim to foster dialogue about the ways in which we as sexuality researchers can mitigate this privilege and its potential impact on our collective research. In so doing, we first explain polyamorous and kinky people and their relationships and review relevant literatures. Second, we detail the aggregated results of 36 studies of polys and kinksters and discuss the factors that shape these two communities. These factors operate at the social and methodological levels, yielding samples that are overwhelmingly white, with relatively high socio-economic status. Third, we examine the ways in which researchers build samples and collect data, and suggest strategies to increase sample diversity. We conclude with an examination of the implications of these findings for the varied sexual and relational identities that comprise kinky and poly subcultures. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","class; demographic; kink; polyamory; race; sexuality",,"Sheff, E.; Department of Sociology, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA, 30303, United States; email: esheff@gsu.edu",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

In the analysis, we identify a Hollywood and a black consensus narrative, but there are important differences in the representational politics of black activists who participated during the Civil Rights Movement and that of Hollywood filmmakers. In particular, our findings reveal that the two Hollywood films downplay black agency, deploy the white heroin character, privilege sentimental aspects over historical references, limit the historical scope of the movement, and use a language of intimacy and optimism about race relations. These depictions sharply differ from the black consensus narrative in which life under Jim Crow, black activism, unity, struggle, and group resilience are emphasized. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","African American history; Civil Rights Movement; Collective memory; Critical reading; Race relations; Symbolic violence; Whiteness",,"Liberato, A.

This pattern of participation reveals 1) that the ""security logic,"" developed by Israeli negotiators led to, and reinforced, a structured gendered division of labor, providing a rational justification for gender inequality; 2) that the ability to control administrative capacities and women workers generated symbolic masculine power and assisted in maintaining asymmetries between Israeli and Palestinian delegations; 3) and that midlevel Israeli negotiators' narratives reveal the extent to which conceptual confusion and self-contradictory approaches toward the Oslo Accords reinforced women's overall invisibility.

The study finds that although Rwandan women have made few legislative gains, they have reaped other benefits, including increased respect from family and community members, enhanced capacity to speak and be heard in public forums, greater autonomy in decision making in the family, and increased access to education. Yet there have also been some unexpected negative consequences, such as increased friction with male siblings, male withdrawal from politics, increased marital discord, and a perception that marriage as an institution has been disrupted by the so-called upheaval of gender roles. Most significantly, increased formal representation of women has not led to increased democratic legitimacy for the government. © Copyright The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Burnet, J.E.; Anthropology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States; email: j.burnet@louisville.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

The post-neoliberal state combines features of both neoliberal and social-democratic welfare policies; significantly, it has introduced changes in areas conventionally noted by feminist scholars as having bearing on the lives of women, such as, in public-funded childcare, and women-centered approaches to governance. The core question posed in this paper is: is the post-neoliberal state also a feminist one? Based on a critical review of recent literature, the analysis focuses on the gender implications of post-neoliberal policies in four domains of society and polity: productionreproduction, the publicprivate, political participation, and the machinery of the state. The paper argues that whilst gains made by some women in these domains are noteworthy, the more fundamental ramifications of the post-neoliberal state are in the changing landscape of gender relations in these countries. © The Author 2011.

Conservative ideas regard increasing female labor market participation as a cause of decreasing fertility on the functioning of a set of general policies to increase fertility rates. It looks into the Polish and Turkish contexts for empirical evidence. The Polish context shows a highly institutionalized system of family policies in contrast to almost unessential institutions in Turkey. Formally, the labor market participation of women is much lower in Turkey than in Poland. Yet, given the size of the informal market in Turkey, womens labor participation is obviously higher than what appears in the statistics. Bearing in mind this divergence, the article suggests Poland and Turkey as two typologies for studying population politics in contexts where socially conservative ideas regarding gender remain paramount. We qualify ideas as conservative if they enforce a traditional understanding of gender relations in care-giving and underline womens role in the labor market as an element of declining fertility. In order to delineate ideational impact, this article looks into how ideas (a) supplant and (b) substitute formal institutions. Therefore, we argue that there are two mechanisms pertaining to the dominance of conservative conventions: conservative ideas may either supplant the institutional impact on family policies, or substitute them thanks to a superior reasoning which societies assign to them. Furthermore, conservative conventions prevail alongside womens customary unpaid work as care-givers regardless of the level of their formal workforce participation. We propose as our major findings for the literature of population politics that ideas, as ubiquitous belief systems, are more powerful than institutions since they provide what is perceived as legitimate, acceptable, and good for the societies under study. In the end, irrespective of the presence of institutions, socially conservative ideas prevail. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, despite their popularity, very little research has been done on the sexual behaviours depicted in these books or on the context in which these behaviours occur. The goals of this study were to gain an understanding of how sex and sexuality are portrayed in contemporary romance novels and to determine whether these portrayals have changed over the last 20 years. It was hypothesized that most depictions of sexuality in romance novels would adhere to Western sexual scripts (Gagnon 1977; Gagnon and Simon 1973; Simon and Gagnon 1986, 1987) and that this would not change over time. The sample consisted of books that had won the Romance Writers of America award for best contemporary single-title romance from 1989 to 2009. A quantitative content analysis revealed that hypotheses were supported with respect to characterization of the male and female protagonists, characterization and context of the romantic relationships, and order and nature of sexual behaviours.

Yet it is not clear whether men or women have become more frequently-or more intensely sexualized-over time. In a longitudinal content analysis of images of women and men on more than four decades of Rolling Stone magazine covers (1967-2009), we begin to answer such questions. Using a unique analytical framework that allows us to measure both the frequency and intensity of sexualization, we find that sexualized images of men and women have increased, though women continue to be more frequently sexualized than men. Yet our most striking finding is the change in how women-but not men-are sexualized. Women are increasingly likely to be ""hypersexualized,"" but men are not. These findings not only document changes in the sexualization of men and women in popular culture over time, they also point to a narrowing of the culturally acceptable ways for ""doing"" femininity as presented in popular media. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender; Media; Popular culture; Sexual socialization; Sexualization",,"Trautner, M.

The existence of Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) has been denied and the epidemic among them ignored although homosexuality in the continent has been documented. Consequently, limited research has been conducted among Africa's MSM. Homophobia has been reported as one of the key forces driving Africa's epidemic because stigma and discrimination may make MSM a hard-to-reach group for HIV prevention and early treatment services. We conducted searches in journals, newspapers, UNAIDS and MSM web sites to read laws, abuse, and discrimination of MSM. We reviewed literature on entertainment education and its success in addressing social, political, and health issues worldwide in order to propose a solution to the issue. Fifty-five percent of African countries have laws against sex between men. Penalties range from fines, imprisonment, or death. Official harassments, state sponsored homophobia and threats against MSM have been documented. Stigmatization can create barriers to testing, restrict utilization of prevention programs, condom use, and failure to disclose HIV status to sexual partners. This paper suggests a communication strategy such as entertainment education to raise awareness and tolerance and to promote action in the fight against HIV/AIDS epidemic and related stigmatization among Africa's MSM. Entertainment Education which derives from various theories can be disseminated through radio or TV and can bring behavior and social change by offering the audience an opportunity for social learning. It has been effective worldwide and examples include Grey's Anatomy, ER, Philadelphia, Soul City, Eastenders, and the telenovela Simplemente Maria and can pave way for HIV prevention and treatment in a vulnerable population. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Entertainment education; HIV/AIDS; Human rights; MSM; Stigma",,"Sallar, A.

For over a decade now, I have been conducting research on women in the world of equestrian sport in Brazil. This paper presents a synthesis of my research, looking at different groups of horsewomen: an initial group were women from the elite world of show jumping; a second group, women jockeys who have struggled to find a niche within the still very masculine world of the turf and finally, my most recent endeavor, a look at women who participate in the popular Brazilian milieu of the rodeo. Through collecting women's testimonies and engaging in ethnographic research employing interactionist methodologies, I seek to understand how these women construct their identities, how they deal with milieu that continue to be largely male and how, within these contexts, they develop self-affirming strategies. It is my contention that, notwithstanding the normative pressures and cultural and/or material obstacles they face, these women, through their ways of being and acting, present a challenge to conventional modes of feminine corporality/subjectivity. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Brazil; Equestrian sport; Gender relations; Homosociality; Horsewomen; Identities",,"Adelman, M.; Universidade Federal do ParanáBrazil",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

Despite the presence of more egalitarian discourses related to sexuality and couple relationships, which prescribe individual autonomy, inter-individual negotiation and mutual sexual satisfaction as a source of well-being of couple relationship, the persistence of more traditional discourses became evident, which reflects a conception of male sexuality as unlimited and the female sexuality as more controlled, maintaining the idea that men and women are essentially different. In this aspect, the silence or submittal were described as the major practices before discrepancies in sexual matters. We discuss the concept of verbal sexual negotiation, suggesting that it would be more an adjustment of meanings, which does not always imply recognition of the needs of the other, but many times a deferral from one member of the couple, generally the woman, in pursuit of the new status of sexuality in the maintenance of the relationship. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Gender; Sexual negotiation; Sexuality; Social individualization",,"Carmona, M.; Pontificia Universidad Católica de ChileChile",,,0104026X,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

As a counter-response to a homogenization and subordination, the Mexican Americans (and, by extension, the Latinos in general) have created new cultural practices (and, among them sportive ones) that put together Mexican traditions with American values of society constituting, in that way, ""a third space"", which extends beyond the borders of both national States.

Emphasising that the interpretive attribution of meaning is always also an engagement with the participants' own pre-interpretations, the article draws attention to the particular difficulties faced in attempting to articulate and confirm the meanings produced by young children. Using a variety of examples drawn from the video records, the article traces the complexities - especially in terms of gender, age and institutional relations - of pursuing and seeking to fix the meanings of transient, highly ephemeral, events. The immediacy, affective intensity and speed of the children's play constitute a serious challenge to adult approaches privileging commentary, reflection and explanation for non-participant others. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","children; interpretation; meaning; play; visual ethnography",,"Richards, C.; Centre for the Study of Children, Youth and Media, London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University of London, London, United Kingdom; email: c.richards@ioe.ac.uk",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

The authors first outline the place of digital methods in the research, describing how software such as Adobe Connect and Survey Monkey, as well as a project Wiki and blog, enabled some virtual communication among and within research sites. They go on to suggest that their experience with these methods exposed the significant limitations of the technology, but also that coming up against these limitations posed useful questions about the nature of specific research methods and about the overall priorities of the study. As an example, the article focuses on how digital methods have usefully complicated available conceptions of 'liveness', an important dimension both of live performance and of ethnographic fieldwork. Despite their skepticism about the promise of new technologies, the authors conclude that their experience valuably relocated research analysis from post-facto interpretation to an ongoing negotiation with method in the field. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","collaborative; digital; drama/theatre; ethnography; global; intercultural; internet; liveness; local; methodology; performance; technology",,"Gallagher, K.; Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; email: kathleen.gallagher@utoronto.ca",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

Rather than seeing this as a simple issue of cultural difference, our analysis seeks to unravel the curious way in which the otherness of school space is acknowledged in educator discourse. Only some place features of school are suggested as a barrier by educators while other aspects - such as the clear identification of insiders and outsiders through school routines and locales - remain unremarked. We conclude by suggesting that schools are inherently exclusionary, a foundational fact which both parents and educators accept and respond to, in ways which both explain the push for engagement within education policy and its irrelevance as a concern for parents. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Australia; Indigenous education; place; race; school-parent engagement",,"Lea, T.; The Northern Institute, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, NT, Australia; email: tess.lea@sydney.edu.au",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

One effect has been shifting boundaries between, and understandings of what constitutes the public and the private with regard to the role of the state vis-á-vis the formation of gendered subjectivities and civil society and the gendering of public- private relations in and between family and work. Drawing on feminist readings of Bourdieu and critical policy sociology, I consider the implications of a move from bureaucratic educational governance framed by state welfarism to corporate or market governance framed by the post-welfare state, and consider whether particular constructions of globalization and corporate/market governance lead to network governance.

The discussion relates to the changing conditions in and ongoing modernization of the public sector - an important employer for women - with a focus on care work organized by the municipalities. The issue that is addressed is the part-time regime that characterizes these jobs and the likely consequences of a policy change on contracted working hours. This change has been brought about by concerns on the need to meet the growing demand for personnel in care work but also by a generally expressed dissatisfaction among the women who are employed part-time involuntarily. The attempt by several municipalities to introduce more full-time positions is a result of a government programme (2002-2005) aiming to reduce the problem with part-time unemployment. Based on the reports from that programme, this article explores the consequences of the ongoing remodelling of the working time regime, especially concerning gender equality. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Gender division of labour; Part-time work; Public sector; Sweden; Underemployment and involuntary part-time employment","gender disparity; labor participation; modernization; policy reform; public sector; unemployment; womens employment; working conditions; Sweden","Jonsson, I.; Department of Economic History, Uppsala University, PO Box 513, Uppsala SE 751 20, Sweden; email: inger.jonsson@ekhist.uu.se",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860392687

This article examines the meaning of food and foodwork for Goan women in Toronto, Canada, and the role of food in creating and maintaining distinctly gendered ethnic identities. Catholic Goan identity, born from Portuguese colonization of an area in what is now Western India, has few unique markers of ethnic distinction from other Indians. In this context Goan cuisine takes on a particular symbolic significance. In this qualitative study with first-generation Canadian Goan women (N = 13) the gendered role of women in foodwork was seen as having particular power or 'currency' within the family and community, valued for fostering and supporting Goan identity. We argue that the same foodwork practices that constitute gendered oppression for women may simultaneously confer a form of 'culinary capital' within the social arena of their own diasporic community. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Ethnic identity; Ethnicity; Food preparation; Foodwork; Gender; Goans",,"Beagan, B.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is one of five significant configurations of the body which come under the broad rubric of 'intersex'. Intersex is a contemporary term to refer to what is historically known as hermaphroditism. To date no sufficient analysis has been undertaken of the representation of intersex in the media, largely because the term intersex fails to make its mark in the media. To address this imbalance this paper analyses the representation of this case in several of the leading Australian media outlets. What is evidenced is that intersex is often omitted in preference for euphemistic alternatives. Thereby, it is argued that media coverage mirrors the cornerstone of the medicalisation of intersex; that is, the institutionalisation of silence. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Australia; Congenital adrenal hyperplasia; Intersex; Media; Murder",,"Kerry, S.6/12 May St, Elwood 3184, VIC, Australia; email: sckerry@lycos.com",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

Drawing on Judith Butler and discourse theory, the study shows that claiming a position as bereaved can entail struggles concerning acknowledgment of kinship, and that examples of denunciation simultaneously stand out as resistance and subversion.

I argue that pregnancy bed rest significantly disrupts women's sense of control over their bodies, and that this disruption is partly manifested through feelings of failure and self-blame. Women's feelings of failure are heightened within a cultural context that emphasizes the importance of individual control over reproductive processes and ignores marginalized experiences of pregnancy. I then examine how women strategize ways to momentarily regain some control over their self and lives and thereby reduce feelings of failure. Analysis of women's pregnancy bed rest experiences furthers our understanding of an experience that drastically alters women's sense of control and self-discipline as well as their relationship to their bodies. It also sheds light on pregnancy as an experience that is informed at least as much by the cultural context as it is by the body. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Bed rest; Confinement; Discipline; Marginalization; Medicalization; Pregnancy",,"Cristina Alcalde, M.; Gender and Women's Studies Department, University of Kentucky, 212 Breckinridge Hall, Lexington, KY 40506-0056, United States; email: cristina.alcalde@uky.edu",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

How do recent gains in women's rights resonate with the younger generation in the country? How supportive and involved are young people in consolidating these gains? To explore these questions, this article draws on in-depth interviews with thirty-two young men and women. While the sample size is relatively small, the ethnographies suggest complex ways in which youth relate to the gains of the women's movement and women's rights activism. I have identified three broad trends in youth's attitudes: willed self-distantiation, cautious identification and strategic endorsement. They all suggest that the consolidation of recent gains and promotion of gender equity are difficult to achieve without a greater involvement and inclusion of the younger generation.

This exploration is made in terms of feminist academic Cynthia Enloe's analysis of gender dynamics in postwar societies. A well-documented gender inequality, favouring men, is evident in East Timor and there is pressure for women to conform to 'traditional' cultural norms now the war is over. However, through a tracing of gender historically, I argue that 'traditional' social patterns are problematic to define. I will also argue that those pushing women to return to 'tradition' are simply advocating a subordinate role for women. The impact of conflict and violence has been profound for the new nation and its people, so that today both public and private, or domestic, violence is pervasive. Part of this impact is the dominance of an elite male political and military leadership, mostly from former resistance organizations, who are seen as largely responsible for outbreaks of violence on a national scale (occurring between 2004 and 2008). In Enloe's terms such a post-war society may be characterized as militaristic in nature. When such post-war societies privilege a militarized masculinity it is sure to have a detrimental effect on women's participation. I argue here that this dynamic is central to the current pressure for women in Timor-Leste to return to 'traditional' roles now the conflict is over. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Gender; Militarism; Militarized masculinity; Post-conflict; Timor-Leste; Women",,"Niner, S.; Country Monash UniversityAustralia",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

In Egypt, between 2003 and 2010, internationalist feminist campaigns advocated anti-harassment projects that demonized working-class youth masculinities as well as 'disreputable' public femininities in an attempt to intensify the policing of the city and discipline public sociability. Through a politics of respectability and 'strange bedfellow' processes of NGO-ization, this state-allied, pro-enforcement project demobilized class-based movements for democratic change. By contrast, inventive Egyptian organizations adapted UN gender doctrines and legal mechanisms to their own purposes, mobilizing mass campaigns that critiqued frameworks of police protection and social respectability. They cultivated forms of assertive female agency that came to occupy center-stage during the recent Egyptian Revolution of January and February of 2011. By contrasting these forms of global/local feminist organizing, this article reveals the queering power of new metaphors of masculinity, class struggle and global female insecurity.

The Iranian Diaspora can be split into three main historical periods.

It forms part of the museum's Holocaust exhibition where Olga works as a volunteer guide. The blanket represents a testimonial object that carries in its fabric the personal stories of women's witnessing and suffering of events of the Holocaust. This article gives a brief overview of how the Sydney Jewish Museum provides memorial and historical context to the blanket as an authentic artefact and introduces Olga Horak as an embodied witness. The museum is an already gendered space within which Olga and her personal connections with the blanket contribute to the exhibition's narrative about events of the Holocaust. The article then discusses how, in the museum context and also drawing on Olga's written testimony, the blanket is inextricably linked to traumatic past events. Olga bears witness to her own experiences of trauma and suffering and to those of other women as they intersect at a particular historical moment with the blanket's 'biography.' It has also become a significant bearer of collective memory of women's experiences of Auschwitz which are literally and metaphorically woven into it.

The outcomes of this study suggest that while normative notions of gender (as well as race, class, and sexuality) are generally reinforced, cinematic depictions of female athleticism open up possibilities for articulations of bodily and narrative agency and present a challenge to common-sense understandings of the gendered body, what it looks like, and what it is capable of. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","athleticism; body; cinema; content analysis; gender; sport",,"Lindner, K.; University of GlasgowUnited Kingdom; email: klindner79@gmail.com",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

Gimme a Break starred black actress and singer Nell Carter as Nell, a former nightclub singer who was now the lascivious caretaker of a white family. As a single woman living with a single (widowed) white man and his children, the show's use of sexual humor clashed with its refusal to breach the interracial sex taboo. This article argues that Gimme a Break relied upon the delightful difference signified by Nell's black sass and sexuality, but labored to contain it. Part of this strategy was imbedded in Carter's grotesque body; its fat blackness was accorded hypersexuality through its link to the black blues tradition and aberrant black sexuality, but was also deemed unappealing, and therefore safe, within a white context. Another important strategy was to repeatedly deny that Nell and the white father were attracted to each other. However, the gags and storylines meant to disavow this attraction also had to first invoke it. The result of these contradictions and negotiations was that as long as the white father was present on the show, Nell's sexuality was potentially disruptive. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","blackness; femininity; grotesque; race; sexuality; television",,"Fuller, J.; Department of Radio-Television-Film, University of Texas-AustinUnited States; email: jfuller@mail.utexas.edu",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

The current study addresses this gap using an intersectional framework to investigate White college students' stereotypes of Black and White women. How these stereotypes fit with stereotypic images found in theoretical/empirical literature was also examined. Analyses of data from 109 White college students revealed that Black women were perceived in ways consistent with the Matriarch/Sapphire stereotypic image (e.g., strong and domineering). This image stands in contrast to current and previous perceptions of (White) women as affective and communal. The impact of the Matriarch/Sapphire image on Black women is likely mixed. Internalizing the strength aspect of the Matriarch/Sapphire could help Black women cope with the negative effects of racism, sexism, and classism. Conversely, being perceived as innately strong and domineering could increase the blame attributed to Black women who are survivors of sexual assault and/or domestic violence, limiting avenues of support and justice available to these women. It could also lead to a minimization of Black women's mental and physical health problems. Interventions that educate professionals about the Matriarch/Sapphire image could help reduce its negative impact. © The Author(s) 2011.","attribution; Black Women; impression formation; ingroup outgroup; racial and ethnic attitudes; social perception; stereotyped attitudes; stereotypic images",,"Donovan, R.

The authors examined the relationship between self-silencing and disordered eating as well as intuitive eating. The authors also explored whether emotional awareness would moderate these relationships because conflicts over expressiveness are associated with emotional problems and eating disorders. The sample comprised 140 college women (52% White; 36% Black) under the age of 24 from a midwestern urban university. Their results revealed that emotional awareness moderated the relationships between self-silencing and disordered eating and intuitive eating. Specifically, when there were lower levels of emotional awareness, self-silencing with disordered eating and intuitive eating were unrelated; however, with higher levels of emotional awareness together with more self-silencing, participants presented with more disordered eating and less intuitive eating. The findings highlight the importance of supporting women's emotional awareness in conjunction with their expressiveness of thoughts, feelings, and needs to increase intuitive eating and decrease disordered eating. © The Author(s) 2011.","eating behavior; eating disorders; emotional intelligence; expressed emotions; intuitive eating; repression; self-silencing",,"Nilsson, J.; University of Missouri, 5100 Rockhill Road, Kansas City,MO 64110, United States; email: nilssonj@umkc.edu",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

We contribute to the debate by presenting findings from a British qualitative study based on interviews with 15 nonheterosexual women talking about their feelings about their bodies and their appearance in the context of partner relationships. These accounts were analyzed using a phenomenologically oriented form of thematic analysis (TA) and seven main themes were generated. The women suggested that same-sex relationships were both positive and negative influences in shaping their feelings about their body and appearance, highlighting the complexity of this issue. However, positive descriptions of empathy toward body and appearance concerns as well as diversity within same-sex attractions suggest that same-sex relationships have the potential to encourage women to feel happier with their bodies. This analysis also suggests that the theoretical debate is too simplistic and that a synthesized explanation should be explored in future research. © The Author(s) 2011.","appearance; bisexuality; body image; interpersonal influences; interpersonal relationships; lesbianism; physical attractiveness",,"Huxley, C.

Existing research supports this theory; however, few studies have examined the extent to which these two constructs may serve as mediators in the relationship between self-objectification and eating disorder symptoms and/or depression. Therefore, the current study evaluated the potential mediational roles of interoceptive awareness and social anxiety using the nonparametric bootstrapping procedure for multiple mediation. College-aged women (N = 214) completed self-report measures assessing self-objectification, disordered eating, depression, interoceptive awareness, and social anxiety. Results indicate that both interoceptive awareness and social anxiety are significant mediators in the relationship between self-objectification and eating disorder symptoms and depression. These findings lend further support to objectification theory and contribute to a greater understanding of the etiological underpinnings of eating disorders and depression in women. Practice implications of these results suggest that targeting both self-objectifying and socially anxious behaviors and cognitions may be an important component for reducing vulnerability to disordered eating. © The Author(s) 2011.","anxiety; body image; depression; eating disorders; interoceptive awareness; self-objectification",,"Peat, C.

However, no current measure adequately assesses gender expression in this community. Thus, the authors conducted three studies to develop and validate the Gender Expression Measure among Sexual Minority Women (GEM-SMW). First, an initial item pool was evaluated in 3 focus groups with 23 women identifying as butch, femme, or neither. Second, responses from 459 lesbian and bisexual women who completed the revised items as part of an online survey were subject to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), validating 15 items comprising 3 distinct factors assessing appearance, gender roles, and emotional expression. Third, the final model was replicated with a separate online sample of 1,381 lesbian and bisexual women, and measurement invariance (MI) testing demonstrated the stability of the GEM-SMW's factor structure. The GEM-SMW allows researchers to investigate gender expression without requiring participants to specify a gender identity (e.g., butch/femme). It is one of the first gender expression instruments developed specifically for lesbian and bisexual women, yet items may also be applicable for heterosexual women. Finally, the GEM-SMW provides opportunities to investigate the relation of gender expression with other constructs of interest such as identity development, stress, coping, and health. © The Author(s) 2011.","bisexuality; lesbianism; personality measures; physical appearance; sex role attitudes",,"Lehavot, K.; Department of Psychology, University of Washington, VA Puget Sound Health Care System - Seattle Division, 1660 S.

IDVSA is a collaboration of the Schools of Social Work, Law, and Nursing, and 150 community affiliates. Recognizing that interpersonal violence does not occur in a vacuum, the IDVSA operates within an ecological framework in which explanations for interpersonal violence acknowledge that individuals and families are nested in larger mezzo and macro systems, and factors such as gender, poverty, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and immigration status play influential roles in our understanding of these issues. The overarching goal is to advance knowledge and meaningful practice in the field through partnerships with survivors and community practitioners. Specifically, the mission is to advance the knowledge related to domestic violence and sexual assault in order to end interpersonal violence. IDVSA seeks to achieve its mission by focusing on three key areas: (1) rigorous research and scholarship on domestic violence and sexual assault; (2) comprehensive training, technical assistance, and information dissemination to the practitioner community and the community at large; and (3) substantial collaboration with our community partners.

We examined the discrepancy between how college women wanted to respond and how they actually responded to gender prejudice events and explored their reasons for not using a desired response. In this study, 81 college women from the Western United States responded to a qualitative online daily diary about gender prejudice. In 34% (N = 265) of the events, the women reported there was a discrepancy between what they wanted to do and how they actually reacted, with the most common discrepancy being a desire to utilize a confrontational response (91%, N = 242). Over the two week period, women reported significantly more events during which they considered the use of a confrontational response (N = 242) than they actually used one (N = 199). Women's reported reasons for not using their desired response included: not being cost effective (25%), concern about social norms (37%), setting limitations (19%), personality characteristics (9%) and not being bothered enough by the event (10%). We also found that when women considered using a confrontational response but decided not to, they reported using all other response types instead. In these cases, women who did nothing during the event reported lower levels of distress during the event than women who used a psychological response or a different confrontational response.

Children's beliefs about girls and boys (i. e., their gender cognitions) may also play a role in gender segregation, but this idea has received little attention. In this study, we proposed a model of gender segregation that included similarity on gender-typed behavioral qualities (e. g., rough and tumble play) and gender cognitions concerning perceived similarity to same-gender others, and we assessed whether this more comprehensive heuristic model predicted observed peer interactions in young U. S. children (n = 74; M age = 51 m; middle-class families). A multi-method design was employed including observations of behavior and child reports of gender cognitions. Support was found for the linkages proposed in this comprehensive model for boys; partial support was found for girls. Specifically, the inclusion of gender cognitions was supported for both genders: gender cognitions about perceived similarity related to interactional partner choices for both girls and boys, and accounted for variance in observed partner choices even after behavioral similarity was included in the model. The traditional link concerning behavioral similarity on rough-and-tumble play predicted boys' but not girls' interactions. The findings extend knowledge about the role of social cognitions in social behavior, and are consistent with ideas proposed by gender schema theory and other constructivist theories. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender cognition; Gender schemas; Gender-segregation; Peers",,"Martin, C.

They contrast their hypothesis with the interpersonal orientation hypothesis and provide convincing evidence for further examination of the importance of status in relationships.

It provides a foundation upon which changes in representation over time may be mapped; contributes toward a cross-national literature that considers differences in representation; and tentatively examines how representations intersect with other key social categories. A sample of 5,803 advertisements was collected during 2003 that included 1,633 primary visual actors and 2,350 narrators. These were analysed by means of content analysis. A coding scheme was developed that was partly based on existing research, including McArthur and Resko's (1975) influential study, but also research within non-Western contexts. Content categories included attributes of the primary visual actor (i. e., age; portrayal; race; and social class) as well as advertisement attributes (i. e., actors; primary narrator; products; and setting). Hypotheses predicted that males and females would be represented differently in television advertisements and that these differences would reflect traditional hierarchical relations in society. Findings largely supported these hypotheses. Males were represented as dominant. They were of primary focus; appeared most frequently within the socially valued public-work arena; and were represented as occupying positions of greater social authority. Females were represented as subordinate. They were of secondary focus; appeared most frequently within the socially undervalued private-domestic arena; and were most often represented as occupying positions of social subordination. This subordination was reinforced through findings that imply their sexualisation. Interesting patterns also emerged in findings indicating possible change in representations of gender. The implications of findings are discussed and suggestions for future research are made. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender representation; Gender role portrayal; South Africa; Television advertising",,"Luyt, R.; Department of Psychology, University of Winchester, Winchester, Hampshire SO22 4NR, United Kingdom; email: russell.luyt@winchester.ac.uk",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960990845

Understanding the potential impact of daily hassles is important due to indications that African American women report greater daily hassles and have higher incidence rates of stress-related disorders. The current study examines the relationship between daily hassles and psychological functioning (e. g., depression and anxiety symptoms) among 103 U. S. African American adolescent females (M = 15. 50; SD = 1.70) residing in a moderately-sized Midwestern city. Additionally, this investigation explores gender role orientation as a moderator of this relationship. Results indicated that increased daily hassles were associated with greater depressive and anxiety symptoms. Also, this investigation provides some support for the direct and moderating role of gender role orientation. A greater feminine or androgynous role orientation was associated with fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. In addition, although not directly associated, this investigation indicated that a masculine role orientation moderated the association between daily hassles and girls' psychological outcomes. Specifically, among African American adolescent females with a greater masculine role orientation, increased daily hassles were associated with reduced psychological functioning (e. g., greater depressive and anxiety symptoms). Neither feminine nor androgynous role orientation, however, moderated the relationship between daily hassles and psychological functioning (e. g., depressive and anxiety symptoms).

To test predictions derived from gender schema and social role theories, relationship suggestions from Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus (Gray, 1992) were presented in masculine, feminine and neutral versions to 355 undergraduate students in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Participants either made descriptive stereotyping ratings or indicated their own preferences for the relationship suggestions. Half of each group was asked to respond as if the relationship in question was a romantic one, and half for a college roommate. When making descriptive stereotyping ratings, participant responses were in the stereotypic direction but with the means all close to the neutral midpoint. When making preference ratings, both women and men preferred neutral versions of the items over masculine and feminine versions, and women liked all types of items more than did men, but the average ratings indicated general appreciation for the items. Participants also liked the items better if the relationship was with a romantic partner rather than a college roommate. The highly positive reactions of all participants to all types of items and the failure to find consistent patterns of gender-stereotypic responses across rating methods and relationship contexts suggest that gender differences in relationship preferences may be less dramatic than portrayed in popular books. It is argued, however, that such books can impact readers' perceptions of gender and relationships. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender differences; Relationships; Sexism; Stereotyping",,"Signorella, M.

S. society. Based on the evidence that spousal conflict adversely influences physiology and health, with greater negative impact on wives compared to husbands, we propose that the stronger impact of relationship negativity contributes to the decreased marriage benefit for women. Evidence bearing on two explanations for this differential impact of conflict is reviewed. The relational-interdependence view, proposed by Kiecolt-Glaser and Newton (2001), holds that women are more affected by marital conflict because of their more relationally interdependent self-representations. An alternative view, which we call the subordination-reactivity hypothesis, suggests that women experience greater physiological and psychological reactivity to marital discord because they typically occupy subordinate (lower status and less powerful) positions relative to their husbands. A review of the evidence on the physiological effects of social status is combined with that of the relationship between gender and status, both within society at large and interpersonal relationships specifically, to support the subordination-reactivity hypothesis. Specifically, there is evidence that low social status negatively impacts health and that women generally occupy subordinate status. The relational-interdependence view is re-evaluated and its intersection with the subordination-reactivity hypothesis is explored.

Self-report surveys were administered to 335 predominantly Caucasian Grade 12 girls from religiously-based high schools in the midwestern part of the United States. It was hypothesized that adolescent females' gender-typing of themselves as well as their gender-related attitudes towards others would be significantly, and possibly divergently, related to their perceptions of themselves and their physical bodies. Obtained data were analyzed using multivariate canonical correlation procedures. The results of these analyses revealed support for the predicted overall relationship between gender conceptualizations and self-perceptions, but also indicated some differences in the way in which the two dimensions of gender-role conceptualizations (personal and attitudes towards others) were associated with adolescents' perceptions of themselves. Specifically, girls exhibiting more egalitarian gender-related attitudes towards others scored higher on global self-worth and lower in body appearance orientation. In addition, higher self-endorsement on the masculine subscales was linked with higher global self-worth, lower social physique anxiety, and higher use of competence to evaluate the physical body.

In the current study, 79 early adolescent high school students residing in the Southeastern United States (73% European American) were observed talking about problems with a friend. Of primary interest was whether disclosure to friends predicted changes in self-reported depression over 6 months for girls and boys. Although girls disclosed to friends about problems (especially interpersonal problems) more than did boys, disclosure did not buffer girls from the development of depressive symptoms over time.

Finally, I will analyze the concept of cultural citizenship and how it is being used in various diaspora communities as ways to imagine multiple modes of belonging within and beyond the coherence of national boundaries. I argue that to fully comprehend the lived experience of migratory and diasporic subjects, we, as feminist and diaspora scholars, need to pay heed to how migratory subjects negotiate and rewrite their citizenship status within the nation-state with cultural productions and cultural acts. In the process, migratory and diasporic subjects stake claims to their multiple identities, multiple homes and affiliations, and socio-political membership to the nation(s) and transnational communities.","Cultural citizenship; Diaspora imaginings; Homing desire",,"Hua, A.; Department of Women's Studies, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Drive, San Diego, CA 92182-6030, United States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Design/methodology/approach – A total of 768 undergraduate business students rated either the ideal President or a presidential candidate on Bem Sex-Role Inventory and Implicit Leadership Theory scales. Findings – The ideal President was seen as more similar to male candidates as a group than female candidates as a group (i.e. “think president – think male”). The ideal President was seen as higher in masculinity than femininity (i.e. “think president – think masculine”). Research limitations/implications – Additional factors beyond gender and leader prototypes may affect perceptions of presidential candidates and the ideal President. Respondents came exclusively from northeastern USA; hence, results may not be generalizable to other populations. Replication of this study in nations that have elected a female leader is recommended. Future theory and research should link perceptions of male and female leaders in different nations to dimensions of national culture such as gender egalitarianism. Social implications – The results suggest the continued presence of sex-related biases in leader evaluations in the political context. Such biases influence whether specific groups are excluded from political leadership because of their personal characteristics (e.g. women), which would dilute the talent of the pool of available candidates.

The results illustrate facilitators at the community college, including inspirational professors, effective transfer advising, academic resources, and flexible work schedules, and barriers resulting from ineffective initial advising. After transferring to a four-year institution, the majority of women persisted in STEM majors despite many barriers, such as negative course experiences, poor advising, and limited finances. Finding a helpful professor or advisor and cotransfer support boosted belongingness and contributed to persistence. Two students switched to non- STEM fields, while two students withdrew from the four-year school completely; these students faced significant financial barriers and did not find a helpful professor or advisor in a STEM field.

Complementing the research on how engineering and computer science students cope with challenges, this qualitative study investigated how students capitalize on development opportunities outside of the classroom. Capitalization is defined as proactively and voluntarily seeking out positive opportunities for growth and development. To investigate this construct in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics context, male and female students were recruited from the computer science and engineering departments of a primarily white institution (PWI) and a historically black university (HBU). A total of sixty-two students participating in eight focus groups discussed opportunities for capitalization, as well as supports for and barriers to participating in those opportunities. Results revealed that students engage in formal and informal capitalization activities for intrinsic and extrinsic reasons. Moreover, they perceive a variety of factors that facilitate or constrain engagement in such activities. Similarities and differences between men and women, computer science and engineering majors, and the PWI and HBU were observed. Notably, women perceived their gender underrepresentation as a barrier to capitalization. However, gender appeared to be less of a barrier at the HBU, which offered several supports for capitalization.

Design/methodology/approach – The study adopts a qualitative design, using data collected from semi-structured interviews with four lesbians and eight gay men, all employed in managerial roles in the UK. Findings – Data reveal the importance of workplace friendship as a resource for mentoring, climbing managerial career ladders, fitting into existing work cultures and developing gay and lesbian managerial identities. A significant finding is that participants preferred to befriend heterosexual colleagues, to that end complicating previous research that suggests gay and lesbian friendship preferences tend to be marked by similarity in regard to sexual identity. Work friends enable and constrain the development and visibility of gay and lesbian managerial identities and careers. Research limitations/implications – Although the data are not generalisable, it is of concern that gay men and lesbians continue to be disadvantaged by heteronormative constructions of gender and sexuality. While gender and sexual norms can limit the visibility and embodiment of gay and lesbian managers in the workplace, the study reveals also how gay sexualities can be utilised as a resource for developing influential friendships.

Women who had left engineering cited as reasons the need to care for their children, movement into roles with more opportunities such as management, and a dislike of engineering tasks or environment. Women who remained in engineering also mentioned family responsibilities as challenges. Many took advantage of family-friendly work policies, and some compromised career advancement due to family responsibilities.

Differential dropout has been proposed as an explanation, but few studies have tested this theory for women in graduate engineering programs. Additionally, past research has not taken into consideration how the influx of foreign students into graduate engineering programs may affect women's proportionate enrollment and degree completion. To address these gaps, this study examined factors associated with enrollment and degree completion of female and male students (n = 470) in graduate engineering programs at a state university between 1990 and 2004. Women comprised 14% of graduate engineering students, but were as likely as men to complete doctoral degrees when factors associated with graduation (e.g., final GPA, engineering field) were considered. Among U.S. citizens, women had higher rates of degree completion than men, while the opposite was observed for foreign nationals. If replicated across institutions, these findings suggest that differential enrollment, not differential dropout, is the dominant factor in women's underrepresentation among engineering doctorates.

While biomedicine and the lens of neuroscience now predominate in defining children's troubles, the article primarily focuses on schools as sites that organize daily lives, provide services, and hold keys to future opportunities. It analyzes mothers' reflections on the intersections of race, disability, class, and gender in schools through sixteen oral history interviews. Women of color have long been suspect as mothers whose children are burdensome or costly, and their children have often been labeled with deficiencies. Currently boys and young men of color are disproportionately diagnosed with invisible disabilities and assigned to special education, although they are much less likely to receive psychopharmaceutical treatments than white children. I emphasize two suggestive findings: First, most of the mothers interviewed expressed complex ambivalence toward medicalization, selectively resisting it but also drawing on it to protect the progress of vulnerable children through school. That is, a majority acquiesced to at least some period of medication, yet they remained ambivalent as individual protection from school failure leaves larger cultural images of black male badness unchallenged or even reconfirmed. Second, I show the insights offered by the way some mothers linked race to gender and class, suggesting that medicalization may have a range of meanings according to class privilege (or its lack). Mothers of children of color may have less ambivalence toward medicalization if they can marshal sufficient class resources to supplant images of badness with those of respectability. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

This is true of Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. In this article, we examine how studies on women started in Taiwan and Hong Kong and have become institutionalized in the last two and a half decades. In this period, courses and research proliferated in several disciplines as a result of gender equity policies stipulated by governments, as well as the increasing number of female staff in the faculties of humanities and social sciences. Several reasons account for slow progress in the development of feminist geography: the male-dominated structure of geography departments in both countries; an emphasis on the scientific as opposed to social scientific nature of geography; and a general lack of feminist consciousness among geographers who tend to study issues at a macro level. In addition, the small proportion of women teaching at the university level has also led to setbacks in the development of feminist geography. While there are a few courses that incorporate gender perspectives and lectures on feminist geography have been given as part of other geography modules, gender blindness continues to prevail in teaching and research in human geography. This article, however, sees two recent factors that may help to advance feminist geography in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Firstly, the number of female faculty members and graduate students has increased, thus providing momentum in the appreciation of gender geography. Secondly, Chinese-speaking countries in East Asia have played active roles in internationalizing the discipline, thus connecting themselves with feminist scholars abroad, and increasing opportunities to engage in collaborative work. The IGU Commission on Gender and Geography, which encompasses a diversity of world views, is one avenue for facilitating this trend in the near future. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Feminist geography; Hong kong; Taiwan; Women's movement; Women's/gender studies","feminism; gender issue; gender relations; human geography; institutional framework; trend analysis; university sector; China; Hong Kong; Japan; Korea; Taiwan","Chiang, L.-H.

Here, these practices undertaken by girls are understood not as subversive, or even transgressive, in the face of broader-scale constructions of the self and the collective body, but rather as related moments in the emergence of a complex, tensionridden 'movement' that exceed specific attempts at fixity along the lines of gender. Using archival data, this article examines various embodied practices by 'girl scouts' that were made possible by such attempts at fixity but which also, in turn, opened up new spaces of engagement and negotiation.

Don Hutto Family Residential Facility, a former mediumsecurity prison operated by the Corrections Corporation of America. In April 2007, a group of lawyers sued DHS, arguing that Hutto's conditions violated children's rights. This article first situates family detention in relation to two relatively separate literatures - immigration geopolitics and children's rights - and legal precedent. Second, it shows how noncitizen children are framed more as 'child-objects' in immigration law than agential, liberal subjects. Immigration law figures adults, however, as criminalized migrant-subjects, ineligible for the due process on which liberal legal regimes are based. The article then analyzes how the judge balanced 'irreparable harm' to detained children, the 'public interest', and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) discretion to detain noncitizens. Relying upon 'geostrategic discourses' of external threat and internal safety, the judge argued that US detention represents a safe space compared to families' countries of origin. Twisting national security with the 'best interests of the child', the judge authorized a legal framework for family detention, but with specific spatial requirements. In turn, this new alignment of sovereign and children's rights expanded ICE's power to detain noncitizens. These legal, discursive and spatial tactics form what is called here a geopolitics of vulnerability in which ICE seeks to displace national (in)securities onto detained families. Tracing the intersections of children's legal subjectivity and immigration, the article illuminates deeper struggles over executive power, the spatial practices of immigration enforcement and immigration law. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Asylum; Children's rights; Geopolitics; Immigrant family detention; Immigration law; Subjectivity; T. don hutto","asylum seeker; child welfare; geopolitics; human rights; immigrant; immigration policy; United States","Martin, L.; Department of Geography, University of Oulu, PO Box 3000, Linnanmaa, 90014 Oulu, Finland; email: martin@uky.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960921438

Research limitations/implications: Even though the results are based on a limited number of participants, the study points out factors that can be crucial for women managers' and professionals' health. Further research is needed to corroborate the findings in the study. Originality/value: The paper contributes further understanding of factors that are important for professional women's health. It also suggests that the role of WLC beliefs for health might be more complex than the internal-external dimension. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gender; Health; Managers; Professionals; Women; Work locus of control",,"Muhonen, T.; Faculty of Culture and Society, Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden; email: tuija.muhonen@mah.se",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052645084

Fieldwork was conducted from mid-October to mid-December 2007, employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. My research shows how the critical livelihood strategies of villagers during transition periods shifted from their being dependent on forest resources to work as wage laborers in the nearby large-scale oil palm holdings. Then they were displaced by Indonesian migrant workers; and, presently are confined to their own small-scale oil palm holdings. This shift to oil palm cultivation has been highly gender discriminatory. Its emphasis on physical strength in performing crucial tasks in the harvesting process marginalizes the value of women's contribution and greatly favors men's participation. This has also led to the changing of land inheritance practices, which increasingly favor sons over daughters. At the same time, women have been gradually disempowered as they have lost their roles in decision-making in the management of small-scale farms. Moreover, there have been changes in the relationships among the villagers and all these factors have further strengthened the gender division of labor in the local economy and society. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Division of labor; Gender relations; Livelihoods; Market; Oil palm; Small-scale holdings; State",,"Lai, W.T.",,,12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

The respondents of this study were five mothers whose daughters were victims of incestuous abuse at the hands of their fathers. The data was analyzed using hermeneutic phenomenological methods and the study found that the essential meaning of the mothers experience can be characterized as breakdown followed by a process of healing. More specifically, there were three main stages in the subsequent experience of the mothers: 1) recognizing the severe and damaging breakdown within the family, 2) struggle and loneliness outside the family, and 3) rebuilding the family. Contrary to the traditional portrayal of mothers in such situations, this study found that mothers were neither passive nor lethargic in their recovery process, but rather active and positive in making decisions and choices as they were considerably influenced by their own socio-cultural values and relationships with people that surrounded them. Implications and suggestions are drawn from the findings of the study to suggest improved methods of dealing with women who have to face such tragic situations. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Incestuous sexual abuse; Mother; Phenomenological study; Social worker; South korea; Survival experience",,"Kim, K.H.",,,12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

However, because they are posed, staged, and composed of significant nonhuman artifice, plastinates are ambivalently 'real' as human bodies, let alone 'real' as humans. Plastinates are as much nonhuman as human, and neither category fully accounts for them. In this article, I discuss the consequences of this for feminist theory. Approaches in feminist theory that reify, either implicitly or explicitly, a human/nonhuman binary framework are challenged by plastinates. I show that locating plastinates within either ontological category, though not fully accounting for them, enables feminist critiques of the exhibition; however, these categories also paradoxically permit forms of violence with which feminists are typically concerned. In this way, I argue that plastinates force feminist thought to the very interface of the human/nonhuman divide. When applied to Body Worlds, these concepts at best form a heuristic ontological hinge whose angle is determined by ethical and political commitments, illustrating the ways in which key ontologies should be seen as political strategies more or less amenable to feminist goals, but not more or less true. I argue that what lies at the crux of this hinge, in the case of plastinates, is death, and suggest that Body Worlds demands that the interface of death with life become a key feminist concern. © The Author(s) 2011.","Body Worlds; death; feminist theory; nonhuman; ontological politics; plastination",,"Scott, R.; Genera Research Group, Department of Sociology, Queen's University, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada; email: 7rjs@queensu.ca",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

How is it possible to both love and harm in this context? Building on animal studies and feminist ethics, the theme of emotionality is explored in the section 'loving animals'. Here it is demonstrated that empathy and affection for individual animals, as well as species, are strong components of an experimental ethos expressed by the informants. The second empirical section deals with the issue of 'killing well'. The good kill is supposed to be done with care: quickly and compassionately. This is performed by way of bodily measures of care, technological refinement and personal skills and, sometimes, with the help of a division of labour. In the concluding section, the empirical findings are read through the framework, where the feminist theoretical analysis of love, dependency and care from an embodiment perspective understands the dialectics of instrumentalisation and exploitation of - and care for - animals, not as something that goes on above or outside of relations, but rather as something that can be understood from within. 'Mortal love' is the attempt to capture and theorise this dialectic, arguing that emotions of love and friendship are not mere justifications for the harm and killing performed, but rather intrinsic dimensions of the embodied animaling of experimental human-animal relations. © The Author(s) 2011.","animal studies; animaling; care; feminist science studies; killing; welfare",,"Holmberg, T.; Institute for Housing and Urban Research, Uppsala University, Box 785, SE-801 29 Gävle, Sweden; email: tora.holmberg@ibf.uu.se",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Despite the growing attention that her life-writing has begun to receive in recent scholarship, her later career as a novelist has continued to be overlooked, and thus the significance of fiction as a further site in which she could negotiate the relationship between personal experience and its articulation remains unexplored. This article reads Gooch's life-writing alongside her first novel, charting her search for a mode in which to communicate and give emblematic value to her exceptional life. Without a definitive legal status, she begins in An Appeal to the Public (1788) by expressing her identity within the very discourse that has excluded her in a mimetic version of the legal deposition. Then, in gaining a new context within which to define her character, having redefined herself in the public eye as a writer, her conception of self broadens in The Life of Mrs. Gooch (1792), moving beyond the immediacy of her marital breakdown to encompass her past in its entirety. Within this second text, Gooch demonstrates a nascent awareness of her personal experience as representative of collective concerns, inviting women readers to consider her life as a matter of example. Her first novel, The Contrast (1795), completes this process, passing on hard-learned lessons by reflecting and surpassing the author's experience to re-imagine the prescriptive plot that bound the century's fallen woman. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,,"Steenson, J.email: juliesteenson@yahoo.co.uk",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960807966

In his influential aesthetic treatise A Philosophic Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757), Burke argued that beauty elicits the feelings of love that are the foundation of society; he also asserted that women are more beautiful than men. If Burke's aesthetic theory made women's beauty instrumental to the body politic, Wollstonecraft and More questioned whether the fair sex or society really benefited from the valorization of the exterior of women's bodies. In Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790), A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), and More's Strictures on the Modern System of Female Education (1799), both women writers pointed out the antisocial consequences of the fetishizing of women's beauty. Despite the similarity of their criticisms of Burke's aesthetics, they used their critiques to advance radically different visions of women's place in society.

The Bracero Program left children to endure the absence of theirbracerofathers, while married women and caretakers transitioned into single motherhood under conditions and terms that drove an uncalculated number of these women into undocumented migration to the United States. Separation from their mothers further devastated children. The silence concerning the programme and the whereabouts and intentions of their immigrant parents alienated children from the mothers and caretakers left to care for them. Hence, mothers, caretakers and teachers came together to listen and talk to their children and each other about the dangerous realities of the programme in order to overcome the alienating silence driving them apart within the borders of Mexico. Using archival sources and the oral life-histories of fifty Mexican children and women who endured the programme's separation of their families in San Martin de Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico, I argue that the anxiety and loss of Mexican children and women inspired mothers, caretakers and teachers to transition into instilling a gendered and transnational understanding of the dangers of the programme to their children and among themselves to prevent the onset of permanent alienation from each other. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"child welfare; immigrant; labor relations; migration; recruitment (employment); womens status; Mexico [North America]; United States","Rosas, A.E.; University of California, Irvine, CA, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960688932

Arguably, no aspect of seventeenth-century Quaker behaviour ran more contrary to dominant norms than the insistence on pacifism and rejection of violence. This article considers Friends' pacifism and its relation to masculinity, including its implications for local society, showing how it related to Quaker rejections of domestic violence and to the violent masculinity of the alehouse. However, non-violent forms of control were used to uphold patriarchal norms and to control women and those whose behaviour was considered to be inappropriate. Developing the insights of the social scientist Kenneth Boulding and philosopher Steve Smith, this article explores how Quaker practices of exclusion and ostracism can be seen as highly effective forms of coercion, even if they did not involve physical force, and in doing so highlight how seventeenth- and twentieth-century interpretations of pacifism differ. Quaker identity and discipline were maintained in strikingly effective ways which often mirrored patriarchal norms, and indeed Friends' self-perception is shown to have been highly controlled in order to maintain a collective reputation for sobriety, honesty and restraint. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"gender issue; patriarchy; peace process; perception; seventeenth century; social exclusion; social history; twentieth century; violence; womens status; England; United Kingdom","Bell, E.; University of LincolnUnited Kingdom",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960687139

A key part of this literature dealt with the relative weights of male and female brains, and the assertions of evolutionists and anatomists that fundamental physiological differences explained any observable differences in psychology by natural law. The paper revisits this material with a new set of questions. To what extent did scientific discourse not only subordinate women, but also serve to reinforce a social hierarchy of men? How was manliness, as a natural mental quality, defined, and who did it exclude? Exploring the ways in which scientific literature mirrored discourses of racial, political and citizenship exclusions, substantial revisions to the existing historiography are suggested.

The rapid advance of Japan's military in south-east Asia violently shattered such social boundaries, as many women and non-European volunteers found themselves exposed by retreating Allied forces to the Japanese offensive and took up duties at posts from which their European supervisors had been forced to desert. Mainstream military historiography has often been highly gendered towards what is considered as the male-dominated public domain of the battlefield. In this respect, the involvement of the St John's Ambulance Brigade reveals the process in which colonial ethno-gender identities and hierarchies were being established, appropriated and subsequently subverted by the exigencies of the war in British Malaya. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"gender identity; gender issue; health care; health services; racism; social history; womens status; Malay Peninsula","Liew, K.K.",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960692650

During this period, Sweden became one of the world's most gender-equal countries. Applying a critical qualitative textual analysis, the article shows that the media discourse on gender and sport is, however, not equal. Even if the discourse over time has become less condescending and less explicitly sexist, there are still more or less subtle allusions to women as a sex. From the latter half of the 1990s onwards, it is possible to talk of a pornification of sport which is strongly linked to market adjustment and commercialization. Since pornification affects women to a greater extent, the media image of Swedish elite sport becomes a bastion for the reproduction of inequality. © The Author(s) 2011.","elite sport; gender; language; media; pornification; sexualization",,"Wanneberg, P.

The author discusses these tensions in relation to the notion of feminist genealogy.

The author argues that efforts at (re)mappings and fillings of historical gaps in the production of women's studies knowledge with reference to inclusion and recognition of 'women's experiences' and 'women's voices' (voices that have been silenced or ignored) may render feminists unable to trace and question the political operations that have produced and reproduce 'woman' and 'women' as the significant subject of feminism.

The study considers two important post-structuralist concepts: performativity and heteronormativity. More precisely, the analysis shows how the sexual identities of British heterosexual female teenagers are discursively constructed and regulated via language use when aggressively relating to other girls in Facebook. The analysis is based on the assumption that sexuality is but one aspect of identity. Although on the surface these British teenagers' constructions present masculine 'negative' mean girls, a closer analysis reveals that more subversive and challenging interpretations can be applied. © The Author(s) 2011.","evaluative language; gender studies; relational aggression; sexual identity; social networking; teenage girls",,"García-Gómez, A.; Departamento de Filología Moderna, Facultad de Filosofía y Letras, Edificio Caracciolos, Universidad de Alcalá de Henares, c/ Trinidad, 3. 28801 - Alcalá de Henares, Madrid, Spain; email: antonio.garciag@uah.es",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

The research adopts a qualitative design, using semi-structured interviews with women E&T students. The gendered help women received is shown to be something of a 'poisoned chalice'; although there are sometimes short-term benefits, this is likely to hinder women from progressing in their careers at the same rate as their male peers. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Engineering; Gender; Higher education; Identity; Women",,"Powell, A.; Social Policy Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; email: a.powell@unsw.edu.au",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052054998

Drawing on qualitative and quantitative data from undergraduates in three English universities, this paper presents an analysis of the way in which university mathematics is differentially experienced by men and women, and of the part this may play in women's ongoing narratives of self as mathematicians.

Taking laddishness as a template of hegemonic masculinity, the article contends that male students' heavy alcohol use is partially motivated by discourses that position drinking as a 'normal' part of studenthood, but also by discourses that reinforce drinking as a 'laddish' behaviour or a male preserve. While interviewees recognised the importance of drinking in constructing masculinity, running parallel to this were attempts to disassociate themselves from the extremities of alcohol-induced laddishness and considerations that male peers who drank too much were lesser men. However, in their resistance to these extremities, interviewees demonstrated complicity towards more general attributes of hegemonic masculinity, such as independence and the strength to say no. This highlights the complex and somewhat contradictory processes individuals go through in the construction of gender identities, yet also offers a means through which male undergraduates' risky alcohol use might be challenged. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Alcohol; Hegemonic and complicit masculinities; Higher education students; Laddishness",,"Dempster, S.; Department of Educational Research, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YD, United Kingdom; email: s.dempster@lancaster.ac.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052071069

Specifically, the experimental study investigated whether gender biases are evident in the screening and hiring stage of the personnel selection process depending on the applicants' social role and evaluators' gender. A sample of German undergraduate business students (54 women, 53 men) was asked to make a personnel selection decision (short-listing or hiring) about a fictitious applicant (man or woman) in a specific role (leader or non-leader) for a managerial position. Consistent with social role theory's assumption that social role information is more influential than gender information, participants selected applicants described as leaders over applicants described as non-leaders, regardless of applicant gender. In addition, in the presence of role information, female applicants portrayed as leaders were similarly short-listed and hired as male applicants with the same credentials. In the absence of role information, female applicants were similarly short-listed as male applicants; however, male applicants were hired over female applicants, albeit by male participants only. This is consistent with the shifting standards model's assumption that group members are held to a higher standard to confirm traits on which they are perceived to be deficient: Male participants hired female applicants portrayed as non-leaders with less certainty than their male counterparts possibly due to higher confirmatory standards for leadership ability in women than men.

We argue that the authors undersell the importance of their findings, especially considering shifts in the content and ubiquitousness of mass media. Advances in communication technologies have enabled a new era of objectification, marked by an increasing presence and acceptance of sexual objectification in media, greater pornographic content in mainstream media, and greater acceptance of pornography in U. S. society more broadly. In the years since U. S. scholars began critiquing sexual objectification, its normalization and degree of penetration into our daily lives have increased, largely due to a proliferation of marketing and entertainment media images enabled by the Internet and other communication technology. Given this new era of objectification, we conclude that the phenomenon identified by Heflick and Goldenberg is more likely to influence the success of female politicians now than it was in the 1970s (when the sexual objectification of women was first problematized) and that it may also help explain the recent stagnation in U. S. progress towards gender equity in political representation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Elizabeth Dole; Female candidates; Geraldine Ferraro; Hillary Clinton; Objectification; Sarah Palin; Self-objectification",,"Heldman, C.; Occidental College, Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: heldman@oxy.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959789362

S., few systematic analyses have been conducted on Spanish-language television that airs in the same country. Our team of coders analyzed 466 characters and 481 2-minute intervals on 19 episodes of Spanish-language soap operas or telenovelas that aired in the Los Angeles broadcast area of the U. S. in the summer of 2002. Telenovelas were the programming type selected as they make up the bulk of Spanish-language network television in the U. S. The programs were coded in terms of how gender and race are presented on these programs by first coding the characteristics of speaking characters (including their race and gender) and then coding what actions these characters displayed in 2-minute intervals. Although females and males were represented in equal numbers, gender stereotypes abound. Physical appearance and nurturing roles were more likely to be the focus for female characters while occupational roles were more likely to be the focus for male characters. In terms of race, the overwhelming majority of characters were light-skinned and characters with darker skin were portrayed in extremes and more sexualized.

S. presidential election to Barack Obama and his vice presidential candidate, Joe Biden. During the campaign, Palin's physical appearance, including her reported $150,000 makeover, received extensive media coverage. But, could the focus on her appearance have impacted the outcome of the election? Several lines of laboratory research suggest that this focus may have been detrimental to the Republican ticket because 1) it likely undermined perceptions of Palin's competence, warmth and morality, and 2) it may have increased Palin's focus on her own appearance, which, consistent with research on self-objectification, likely impaired the competency of her actual performance. Voting research supports the importance of candidates' perceived competence and character. Thus, while acknowledging the diverse influences on an election's outcome, a strong empirical case can be made that people objected to Sarah Palin (and therefore, John McCain), in part, because she was objectified. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that men suffer these same consequences when others, or they themselves, focus on their appearance. Therefore, it is not likely that the Democratic Obama-Biden ticket was hurt by these same factors. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Dehumanization; Election results; Objectification; Sarah Palin",,"Heflick, N.

Results indicated significant relationships among self-perceived masculinity/femininity, value endorsements, and the perceptions of value affordances.

Also, value endorsements mediated the relationships between self-perceived masculinity/femininity and traditionality and self-perceived masculinity/femininity and perceived value affordances.

Previous analysis has suggested that fathers are under-represented in children's books and when present, are less likely than mothers to be featured expressing affection towards, or caring for, children. This paper reports the results of a content analysis of a sample of best-selling young children's picturebooks in the UK which feature representations of parents. It was predicted that fathers would feature less often, particularly at home, and be less likely to be depicted sharing physical contact with other family members, involved in domestic chores or childcare activity, or expressing emotion. The results upheld a number of the hypotheses, indicating that fathers remain 'invisible' in an important sense.

In this paper, we address several issues raised by Budesheim (2011) and Heldman and Wade (2011) in response to our article. Specifically, we fine-tune our definition of objectification, provide better evidence that Palin's appearance was highly focused on, and address some alternative accounts (e. g., overcorrection) raised to account for our experimental findings.

Study 2 looks at the most popular games on websites of the same five multinational distributors (N = 54) and analyzes how primary characters are portrayed in terms of appearance and personality. Females are overly represented as primary characters but chi-square analyses indicate no significant differences between sexes in terms of how they are portrayed: of note, neither males nor females are depicted in a sexual manner. These results conflict with previous studies of gender representation in game characters: this paper suggests that sampling methodology and the relatively new trend of casual games excluded this subset of games from prior research.

Specifically, it explores how a utopian, inventive impulse in sexual sociabilities is simultaneously articulated with a dehiscent, corrosive pull away from sociality. An interplay between these two trajectories, we argue, has informed queer theory from its inception. We develop the concept of queer bondsto describe relations radically in excess of humanist and neoliberal accounts of the individual, suggesting queer theory has always been a theory of queer bonds. If sex is (or becomes queer when it is) a force of tearing and symbolic rupture, queer theory teaches us that it is also a forging of sociabilities in this space of rupture. It also teaches us that queer collectivities are always made across and through social negativities. Theorizing queerness in terms of queer bonds rather than queer subjects has two implications. First, we ask whether the closet still functions as a monolithic epistemological regime that produces homosexuality as a question, primarily, of what is known and not known. Instead, we ask how lateral, or ""slantwise,"" forms of reciprocal interpellation between queers may have defined an ""us"" as much as the disciplinary regimes of modernity that invented 'homosexuality.' Second, we ask how we should approach today the question of oppositionality to regimes of social normativity, arguing that an oppositional stance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for queer self-definition. Queer bonds are forged where a resistance to homophobic regimes of knowledge and normalization is articulated with precarious, transitory zones of self-exemption from those regimes. Building on and recasting debates about homonormativity and homonationalism, this introduction argues that we need a theory of queer bonds that can span differences that will remain incommensurable, holding open a space of resistance while acknowledging that queer bonds also produce sociabilities that cannot be apprehended in advance in the terms according to which we have come to understand them. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",,,"Weiner, J.

Approaching toxicity in three different modes, I first consider how vulnerability, safety, immunity, threat, and toxicity itself are sexually and racially instantiated in the recent panic about lead content in Chinese-manufactured toys exported the United States. This analysis, while seeming at first to hover somewhat outside queerness, is completed in the next section, where I interweave biopolitical considerations of immunity into an account of the peculiar intimacies and alienations of heavy metal poisoning, rendered in the first person. The essay ends by suggesting that the queering and racializing of material other than human amounts to a kind of animacy. Animacy is built on the recognition that abstract concepts, inanimate objects, and things in between can be queered and racialized without human bodies present, quite beyond questions of personification. Theorizing this animacy offers an alternative, or a complement, to existing biopolitical and recent queer-theoretical debates about life and death, while the idea of toxicity proposes an extant queer bond, one more prevalent today than is perhaps given credit. Such a toxic queer bond might complicate utopian imagining, as well as address how and where subject-object dispositions might be attributed to the relational queer figure. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",,,"Chen, M.

She suggests that there is also a sociality at stake in human relationality that does not imply the intimate connotations of sociability. This sociality derives from the constitutive conditions of the body itself-a body always given over to others, which exists in a field of social norms and depends on those norms, and those others, for its survival. The ontology of the body is thus a social ontology: we are all over each other, and that is true from the start. The generalized condition of precariousness that characterizes all bodies-and that makes the possibility of both violence and eroticism their constitutive condition-is nevertheless differentially distributed and also politically exploited. Queer theory has played a special role in bringing to light this differential distribution of precariousness, and this means that queer theory is from the outset implicated in politics, indeed in political activism, and cannot be separated from its enactments. We exist in a relation of ""queer bonds"" with-and are obligated to-those ""we"" may never know or recognize. © by Duke University Press.",,,"Butler, J.",,,10642684,,,,"English","GLQ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959877334

First, a text is queer, regardless of the queerness of its authorial persona, if it carries the inscription of sexuality as something more than sex. This is argued in relation to Djuna Barnes's novel Nightwood (1936) and David Cronenberg's film Crash (1996). Second, the understanding of sexuality in queer theory has been compromised by the confusion of sexuality with gender. Despite the liberalization of LGBTIQ gender identities, some sexual identities are still stigmatized as paraphilias (formerly perversions) or identity disorders. Queer theory needs to reconsider sexuality in the Freudian sense of polymorphous-perverse, in its ungovernable, compulsive, and unconscious dimensions.

Though queer collections of visual culture and queer family romance are independent variables, the essay addresses their intersection. The first part briefly outlines how queer collections, regardless of the stylistic and iconographic affiliations of particular objects, are constituted in ""family resemblances"" among objects that tend, overall, to inflect the entire array in terms of nonstandard sexualities and erotic attractions. The second part considers how Freud handled the question of family romance in his most notable treatment of a famous historical artist, Leonardo da Vinci, and suggests that a concept of queer family romance, though overlooked by Freud, might extend and improve the Freudian account of Leonardo's sexual subjectivity (as well as his subjectivity as an artist) and go some way toward explaining why Leonardo's art played a paradigmatic role in later collections of queer visual culture and why Leonardo occupied a major place in later family romances of artistic subjectivity. The third section considers an example of the intersection of queer family romance and the collection of visual culture, namely, the collection of paintings, objets d'art, and other items of visual and material culture gathered and exhibited by William Beckford at Fonthill Abbey from about 1795 to about 1820. The essay concludes by suggesting that queer family romance in collecting visual and material culture constitutes a possible matrix of queer bonding that might supplement, or even provide an alternative to, the social relations of juridical kin or real biological family; because queer families constituted extrabiologically (i.e., in activities of generating cultural forms) can function psychically and socially as family in the fullest sense, they deserve more attention in contemporary debates about the legal-political status-even the very identity-of nontraditional family structures. © 2011 by Duke University Press.",,,"Davis, W.",,,10642684,,,,"English","GLQ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959860632

At the crux of this inquiry are the contradictory strategies of self-representation throughout. To this end, it explores the consequences of ""speaking for"" another and of representing oneself relationally. It also examines how the dynamic between the singular and the multiple within the narrative voice articulates the connected themes of family, gender, and authority, and how its narrative choices engender it as an act of resistance. In this context, it focuses on the theme of illiteracy. This study fleshes out the ways in which this text constitutes self/selves rather than assuming either the uniqueness of the literary self or overall textual coherence. © The Author 2011.

However, religious abuse may occur when a religious group or leader, whether intentionally or unintentionally, uses coercion, threats, rejection, condemnation, or manipulation to force the individual into submission of the religious views about sexuality. The abuse may result in great harm to the victim by causing low self-esteem, guilt, shame, spirituality loss, substance abuse, or thoughts of suicide.

The average age of women in the sample was 54.2 years, and a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds was represented. We found that in describing their contemporary sexual experiences, contextual issues were brought heavily to bear as participants drew on discourses of personal history and biography, including previous relationships, to explain their current sexual experiences. However, a few women foregrounded physiological and biological reasons associated with hormonal changes to explain alterations in their sexual relationship, although overall, these were featured to a far lesser extent compared with their prominent position in biomedical menopause literature. A dominant feature of data was the influence of the discourse of the male sex drive, and many women explained their lesser interest in sexual activity compared with that of their partner in terms of men's nature. The findings suggested that for participants, anxiety around sexuality was socially produced either through the expectation to satisfy a partner, or by dominant discourses that defined sexual engagement as ""healthy"" and sexual apathy as ""unhealthy."" © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adult sexuality; Menopause; Qualitative studies; Reproductive health; Women",,"Hyde, A.; School of Nursing, Midwifery, and Health Systems, University College Dublin, Health Sciences Center, Belfield Campus, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland; email: abbey.hyde@ucd.ie",,,19317611,,,,"English","Int.

Study results are based on a 2009-2010 large-scale national probability survey of young adults aged 18 to 24 years in Croatia (n = 1,005) and Norway (n = 871). The findings corroborated the persistence of the dual model of sexual initiation in Europe (Scandinavian vs. Mediterranean), in which Norwegian women and Croatian men reported coital debut at an earlier age than their gender counterparts. Age difference between partners and the prevalence of condom use at first coitus were similar in both countries, with differences in contraceptive choices emerging with time. Young Norwegian men and women switched from using condoms to hormonal contraception when having been coitally active for some time. Interestingly, ""the pill"" remains rather unpopular among young Croatian women. Controlling for selected variables, using a condom at most recent sexual intercourse was significantly associated with condom use at first intercourse in all groups except Norwegian men, as well as with years of coital activity (except among Croatian men). Additionally, the odds of a condom being used at most recent intercourse were significantly correlated with same-sex sexual experience (only among Norwegian men) and with reporting the most recent intercourse with a casual partner (only among Norwegian participants). Country-specific patterns of contraceptive use are discussed in the context of public health and prevention. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Coital debut; Condom use; Culture; Europe; Reproductive health; Young people",,"Træen, B.; Department of Psychology, University of Tromsø, NO-9037 Tromsø, Norway; email: bente.treen@uit.no",,,19317611,,,,"English","Int.

In addition, clinicians working with GLBT youths in various contexts may be ill-equipped to provide the needed resources for this population of youths and families (Burgess, 1999).

An inventory of research on women and gender that has appeared in CES journals and textbooks finds little on topics other than formal labor markets in transition economies. The study contrasts this literature on women and gender in transition economies to research on this topic by women from transition economies, a literature that CES journal authors do not reference.

The study adds to previous international field experiments by providing additional analysis of the Swedish labor market to determine whether hiring discrimination is a primary cause of occupational gender segregation. The results show that, on average, women have a somewhat higher callback rate to interview in female-dominated occupations, while in male-dominated occupations there is no evidence of gender difference.

While the CSG eases women's burden of care and responsibility for household and child survival, women remain largely responsible for caring and looking after families. This prevails despite increased opportunities for women in society and some small shifts in gender relations in urban areas.

In response, BRAC in Bangladesh experimented with an innovative approach that combined livelihood creation, financial services, and social safety nets in order to 'graduate' participants out of extreme poverty and toward a sustainable livelihood. Inspired by BRAC's success, CGAP and the Ford Foundation launched an initiative to test and adapt BRAC's approach in a variety of countries and contexts through their Graduation Programme. This paper focuses on the Graduation Programme implementation in West Bengal, India. By using a qualitative life history approach, we found that prior to joining the programme, participants had different 'idiosyncratic resources and risks' that defined their starting points. Programme performance among participants was largely based on a combination of these starting points, programme functioning, and the use of personal agency. Where the programmes were implemented as designed, they succeeded in strengthening participants' individual and household resources, and access to social networks, and expanding certain spheres of influence. However, some constraints were too deeply established to influence. © Oxfam GB 2011.","Extreme poverty; Graduation; Social protection; West bengal",,"Huda, K.; BRAC Development Institute (BDI), 32-36 Loman Street, London, SE1 0EH, United Kingdom; email: khuda@ids.ac.uk",,,13552074,,,,"English","Gender Dev.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960589109

These include different physical and biological needs, a dependency relationship and institutionalised disadvantage, each with practical implications for the design and implementation of social protection.

Consequently, even though the Czech Republic legalized registered partnerships for gays and lesbians in 2006, legal barriers now exist regarding parental rights for same-sex couples, who are prohibited from adopting children and accessing reproductive technology once they register with the state. This article examines a rising, new wave of Czech lesbian activism that has focused on gaining legal parental rights for registered same-sex couples. While lesbian activists were disempowered in terms of their public visibility as well as political involvement during the 1990s, the recent growing prominence of lesbian groups has been enabled by their stronger political focus and organizational coherence. Analyzing the lesbian activists' strategies, I show not only how lesbian activism can advance the public debate about traditional gender roles, but also how lesbian activism can strengthen the critique of the ideology of marriage. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Czech lesbian activism; Gay and lesbian parental rights; Gender roles; Lesbian families; Registered partnerships","article; child parent relation; civil rights; Czech Republic; female; homosexuality; human; legal aspect; lesbian; male; marriage; parent; politics; Civil Rights; Czech Republic; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Marriage; Parenting; Parents; Politics","Fojtová, S.; Women's Studies, Transylvania University, 300 N.

Contextual factors which shape those meanings are also described. Design/methodology/approach: In-depth interviews, based on a series of interview guides were conducted with a sample of 14 women in their pre- and post-retirement years. The data were coded using a grounded theory approach and typology classification schemes. Findings: Retirement was alternately conceptualized as a new period of life affording freedoms and growth, as a natural final phase, as a frightening period due to losses, and/or as a pinnacle of accomplishment or relief. The contextual influences of family, friends, and unique attributes of one's profession (e.g. having jobs with transferrable skills and/or having physically demanding jobs) help create meanings. Finally, meanings were found to shift over time in concert with changing contexts. Research limitations/implications: Women have a wide range of responses to their own retirement. The stereotype that they will easily replace the work role with family and/or household roles does not hold for all. Practical implications: By truly understanding the particulars of each employee's situation, managers can assist employees in the transition into retirement such that it is a smooth one. Managers might also be able to more immediately identify employees, who would be willing to return to the organization in a consulting or short-term capacity following retirement. Originality/value: The longitudinal data offers a unique vantage point, such that meanings can be traced over time in a way that has not yet been documented in empirical work. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Aging; Career development; Gender; Longitudinal; Retirement; Women",,"August, R.

Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey methodology was used to identify aspirations in a sample of 1,068 employees from the Australian Local Government Association. Findings: Mature-aged women were very interested in continuous learning at work despite their limited formal education. Their training preferences consisted of informal delivery face-to-face or online in the areas of management or administration. Younger women were interested in undertaking university courses, while a minority were interested in blue collar occupations. Practical implications: Through the identification of patterns of TE and T&D aspirations, long term strategies to develop and retain women in local government may be developed. Findings suggest that mature-aged women would benefit from additional T&D to facilitate entry into management and senior administration positions, as well as strategies to facilitate a shift in organizational climate. Social implications: Mature-aged women were found to be a potentially untapped resource for management and senior administrative roles owing to their interest in developing skills in these fields and pursuing TE. Younger women may also benefit from T&D to maintain their capacity during breaks from employment. Encouragement of women in non-traditional areas may also address skill shortages in the local government.

The concept of empowerment can be explored through three interrelated dimensions: agency, resources and achievements. Agency refers to processes by which choices and abilities are made, resources are the medium through which agency is exercised and achievements are the outcomes of agency. Specifically, this paper seeks to examine an indicator of GEM specifically in the achievements in politics based on data from selected developed and developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: A GEM indicator based on percentage of female parliamentarian taken from secondary sources such as United Nations Development Programme was used in the analysis of empowerment. The developed countries were represented by Norway, Australia and Japan; while the developing countries are Malaysia, the Philippines and China. Findings: There are variations in the achievement indicator in terms of percentage of female parliamentarians in the two groups of countries. Reasons for variations are explained. Research limitations/implications: Although the analysis was limited to the secondary data of the selected countries only, the results may have valuable implications to women's studies and human resource development practitioners particularly at institutional and policy-making levels of the respective countries. Originality/value: GEM is a concept which is lacking in terms of definition. Thus, the study could contribute to a fuller understanding of one of the GEM indicators, inevitably towards constructive solutions to improve the participation of women in public function. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Australia; China; Developed and developing countries; Female parliamentarian; Gender; Gender empowerment measure; Japan; Malaysia; Norway; The Philippiness",,"Ismail, M.; Department of Professional Development and Continuing Education, Faculty of Educational Studies, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia; email: mismail@educ.upm.edu.my",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960650296

Moreover, having a history of CSA may increase risk for sexual victimization in adulthood (revictimization). A number of studies explore the issues of CSA, ASA, revictimization, and adjustment in women, but far fewer studies investigate these issues in men. This study explored the phenomenon of sexual revictimization and related adjustment difficulties in 1,002 male college students who completed the Life Experiences Questionnaire, an expanded version of the Sexual Experiences Survey, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised. Results indicated that male CSA survivors are more likely than nonvictims to experience ASA and that sexual victimization and revictimization are related to increased adult adjustment difficulties in the forms of posttraumatic stress, hostility, depression, and general distress. Research and clinical implications are discussed, such as the need to assess male psychotherapy clients for sexual victimization and revictimization histories and the need for research on the mechanisms resulting in psychological adjustment difficulties in male survivors of sexual victimization and revictimization. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Adjustment; Men; Rape; Revictimization; Sexual abuse",,"Aosved, A.C.; Department of Veterans Affairs, Pacific Islands Health Care System, 459 Patterson Road, Honolulu, HI 96819, United States; email: Allison.aosved2@va.gov",,,15249220,,,,"English","Psychol.

Specifically, the present research tested the hypothesis that BIS sensitivity partially mediates the effects of two aspects of gender role conflict, restrictive emotionality, and restrictive affectionate behavior between men on attitudes toward psychotherapy. To achieve this goal, 285 male college students completed measures of gender role conflict, attitudes toward psychotherapy, and BIS and BAS sensitivity. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized model against several alternative models. Contrary to expectations, no support was found for the hypothesis that BIS partially mediates the effects of restrictive emotionality and restrictive affectionate behavior between men on attitudes toward psychotherapy. However, restrictive emotionality was found to predict both BIS and attitudes toward psychotherapy. Additionally, a dimension of BAS sensitivity, BAS Drive, was also found to uniquely predict attitudes toward psychotherapy. In contrast, neither BIS nor restrictive affectionate behavior between men was significantly associated with attitudes toward psychotherapy in the SEM models. Taken together, these findings suggest that restrictive emotionality and BAS Drive are the dimensions of gender role conflict and motivational disposition most strongly associated with attitudes toward psychotherapy. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Attitudes toward psychotherapy; Behavioral inhibition; Gender role conflict; Help seeking behavior; Motivation",,"Tsan, J.Y.; VISN 17 Center of Excellence for Research on Returning War Veterans, 4800 Memorial Drive (151C), Waco, TX 76711, United States; email: jack.tsan@va.gov",,,15249220,,,,"English","Psychol.

Using newspaper coverage of femicide cases across the state of North Carolina over a 6-year period (995 articles representing 299 cases), the current study examines the news media's use of direct and indirect victim-blaming language, the sources cited in femicide reporting, and whether femicide cases are contextualized as an individual problem or within the broader social issue of intimate partner violence (IPV). Consistent with previous research, findings indicate that public sources (i.e., law enforcement) were the most commonly cited sources of information in news coverage of femicide compared to private sources (i.e., friends and family); however, domestic violence experts are cited more often than in prior studies. In addition, direct and indirect victim-blaming language is not as pervasive as previous research has suggested.

It draws on ethnographic research about the training of unemployed migrant women as domestic workers in Paris to address the ambiguities that underlie the enterprise of professionalizing domestic service. The qualitative data presented in the article show how essentialist ideologies operate within training practices of domestic workers. They reveal that the training practices challenge the association of the job with domesticity, but fail to acknowledge the racist organization of domestic service. Hence, they endorse essentialist constructions of cultural difference. Training practices are also consistent with current neoliberal policies and discourses on unemployment and employability, as they are framed by the normative reference to an entrepreneurial model of society. Finally, the data suggest that migrant women's experience of domestic service as a prospective job and their scepticism about the enterprise of professionalizing radically differ from the instructors views. © 2011 Feminist Review.","domestic service; employability; gender; migration; racism; vocational training",,"Scrinzi, F.; University of Glasgow, Research Centre on Gender Work and Mobilities, CNRS, Paris, France",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

In what ways does it codify existing structures? How does it resist them? Whose stories are not being told, or read? In this article I use Doris Lessing's novel The Fifth Child (1988) as a text with which to begin to address the above questions by reading with attention to the mother story but also the other stories operating both within and outside of the novel; in particular I am concerned with the convergence of maternity, disability and narrative. The novel's co-implication of sexual difference and corporeal difference reveals the ways in which the mother's story is both made possible and authorized by the disabled body of her child, and by his inability to tell his own story. Yet, if The Fifth Child is a horror story that uses the disabled child's body as its ground, it is also about the horror of maternity, in its conception and attendant choices. In this fictional story as well as in the socialhistorical narrative circulating at the time of its publication in the late 1980s, both child and mother are indicted in their otherness and it is ultimately impossible to separate one from the other. © 2011 Feminist Review.","1980s; disability studies; Doris Lessing; feminist theory; maternity; narrative",,"Clark, E.; English Department, University of Wisconsin, Madison, United States",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Much recent research conducted among these groups aims to counter the rather negative accounts prevailing in public discourses on gender and Islam. This literature notably argues that women's conscious turn to Islam is not necessarily a reaffirmation of male domination, but that it constitutes a possibility for agency and empowerment. However, when faced with certain traditionalist positions defended by these women, even this well-meaning literature seems precarious, left in a state of uncertainty. Taking this puzzlement as a point of departure, this contribution aims to think about the dilemmas involved in articulating a language for women's dignity and self-realization, which competes with dominant languages of equality, individual rights and autonomy. This project is rendered even more intricate by the fact that these pious Muslim women socialized in Europe have also been partly fashioned by the liberal discourses against which they want to position themselves. © 2011 Feminist Review.","ethics; Europe; Islamic revival; rights; subjectivity; women",,"Jouili, J.

Through a mode of secular nostalgia, which mobilizes the understanding of the Netherlands as a place par excellence of emancipation for both women and sexual minorities, the Dutch secular arrangement is restructured in new exclusionary ways. Second, it explores how dominant discourses on the symbolic and material borders of the nation interpellate young Muslim women who often figure as the central subjects of debate.

The most radical of the demands of this new social movement is the struggle for land rights and the creation of new women-centred family formations. Through an analysis of their collective demands, I argue that the normative, dependent woman is mutually constituted not only at the intersections of gender, kinship and heterosexuality, but also spatially, through denial of rights to land. As single women disown their dependence upon husbands/fathers/brothers and demand land rights, they simultaneously re-imagine gendered selves by envisioning new marital families and re-working the division of labour. © 2011 Feminist Review.","Indian women; land rights; single women; social movement; widows; women's movement",,"Berry, K.; Humboldt State University, California State University SystemUnited States",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

In this article, I consider different modes of representing women's experiences in French immigrant communities. These representations relate to the French feminist movement Ni Putes Ni Soumises (neither whore nor submissive), a movement that in the early 2000s deplored both the sustained degradation of certain banlieue neighborhoods and also the charges and restrictions that this entails, particularly for young women. Drawing on different narratives and images of women's painful experience, I consider, in a first step, how the question of representing violence against (post)migrant women is framed in terms of the tension between universality and particularity within French republicanism. In the next part of my argument, I bring into focus the question of how to access women's suffering. For a perspective on pain not as an interiorized, private experience but as an accessible complex of practices, articulations, memories, visions and social reconfigurations, I consider Sman Laacher's sociological study (2008) about written testimonies of violent experience that had been addressed by (post)migrant women to French women organizations such as Ni Putes Ni Soumises. I finally suggest reading women's accounts on violence not in relation to a universal discourse of rights, but as a political contestation of the naturalized order of representing violence, suffering and agency inside French banlieue communities. Drawing on Jacques Rancière's notion of dissensus, such a contestation can be staged through words by those who have no visibility in the representational order, words not to criticize the unaccomplished ideals of universal equality, but to create a universal community and a common language of experience in the mode of as-if. © 2011 Feminist Review.","dissensus; pain; violence against women; visibility",,"Dornhof, S.; Graduate Program Lebensformen and Lebenswissen, European University Viadrina, Frankfurt/Oder and Potsdam UniversityGermany",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Drawing on ethnographic material from research on young Muslims engaged in Islamic youth and student-organizations in Norway, I investigate some of the challenges that researching religious subjectivities and practices pose to feminist theory. In particular, I deal with how to understand women's religious piety in relation to questions of self, agency and resistance. Engaging with Saba Mahmood's work on The Politics of Piety, this article suggests ways of understanding the young women's religious engagement that move beyond the confines of a binary model of subordination and resistance, coercion and choice. Grounding the discussion in ethnographic analysis of how young Muslim women in Norway speak about the self, I argue that critically revisiting feminist notions of agency, autonomy and desire, is necessary in order to understand the kinds of self-realization that these women aspire to. However, the article argues against positing Muslim conceptions and techniques of the self as the other of liberal-secular traditions. Rather, I show how configurations of personhood, ethics and self-realization drawn from Islamic and liberal-secular discursive formations inhabit not only the same cultural and historical space, but also shape individual subjectivities and modes of agency. © 2011 Feminist Review.","agency; Norway; piety; self; young Muslims",,"Jacobsen, C.

Different researchers have focused on the various significations of this bodily practice, both in its gendered dimensions, its identity components, its empowering potentials, as a satorial practice or as part of a broader economy of bodily practices which shape pious dispositions in accordance with the Islamic tradition. Lesser, however, has this been the case for the practice of not veiling or unveiling. If and when attention is accorded to the latter, it is often grasped as a product of integration or an effect secular governmentality, but only rarely as a bodily practice. Drawing on narratives of second generation secular and religious Maghrebi Muslims in Belgium, this paper pursues this second perspective by examining to which extent not-veiling can be understood as a technique of the self (Foucault) that is functional to shaping a liberal (Musilm) subject. While a first part of this article will unpack the ethical substance of such discursive interrogations and point to the ways in which they are intertwined with the enactment of a liberal self, the second part will examine the embodied contours of this problematization, which appeared through the labour upon one's affect and bodily dispositions that this refusal of the hijab, or the act of unveiling, implies. © 2011 Feminist Review.","embodiment; liberal Muslims; Not-veiling; piety; secularism; self-technique",,"Fadil, N.; Catholic University of Leuven, KULeuven, Belgium",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

This process has commonly been analysed in terms of its empowering effects for Muslims via the emerging institutionalisation of Islam. The modes and techniques of power at stake in this process have yet often been undermined. Through the lens of Foucault's concept of governmentality, the starting point of my article is one particular dialogue forum, initiated by the German state in 2006- the Deutsche Islam Konferenz (DIK)- whose primary goal is to institutionalise and regulate the communication between Muslims and state actors and thereby to regulate the conduct of Muslims. Focusing mainly on the way in which gender and Islam have been coupled and played out in this initiative, I argue that the DIK is less a dialogical encounter than a tool of a broader civilising liberal project. Through the inquiry into the modes of power operating in this state led dialogue initiative the article shows that while aiming to secure Muslim's integration into German society and to liberate Muslim women from restrictive gender norms, the DIK operates as an enactment of a particular notion of freedom with normative and normalising implications. © 2011 Feminist Review.","dialogue; Germany; governmentality; Muslims",,"Amir-Moazami, S.; Department of Social and Political Sciences, European University Institute, Florence, Italy",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

The majority of YMSM had tested for HIV in their lifetime and had undertaken their most recent HIV tests as part of a scheduled health checkup or test, or a desire to know their status.

Taken together, multivariate analyses indicated that younger men, API men, and those using stimulants were less likely to have tested for HIV.

While there is a perception that rural seniors have well-developed social networks to meet their daily needs, some research suggests that economic and social restructuring processes have impacted the stability of seniors' support networks in small places. While much of the research on seniors' informal networks focuses upon small towns in decline, booming resource economies can also produce challenges for low-income senior women living alone due to both a higher cost of living and the retrenchment of government and service supports. Under such circumstances, an absence of informal supports can impact seniors' health and quality of life and may lead to premature institutionalization. Drawing upon a household survey in Fort St. John, British Columbia, we explore informal supports used by low-income senior women living alone in this different context of the Canadian landscape. Our findings indicate that these women not only have a support network that is comparable to other groups, but that they are also more likely to draw upon such supports to meet their independent-living needs. These women rely heavily on family support, however, and greater efforts are needed to diversify both their formal and informal sources of support as small family networks can quickly become overwhelmed. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aging; Networks; Poverty; Resource towns; Rural; Women","aged; article; Canada; family size; female; human; poverty; psychological aspect; quality of life; rural population; social support; Aged; British Columbia; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; Poverty; Quality of Life; Rural Population; Social Support; Women","Ryser, L.; Rural and Small Town Studies Program, University of Northern British Columbia, 3333 University Way, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; email: ryser@unbc.ca",,,08952841,,,21767084,"English","J.

However, the problems and the resistance against women in the workshops were rarely discussed. One possible explanation for not addressing the obstacles that the girls risked facing is that great hopes were attached to changing gender roles. The major school reform that was about to be launched was also expected to lead to more equal educational choices. In addition, girls' choices were associated with tradition and an outmoded society.

This has affected academic research, HIV/AIDS programmes, and sexuality education, all which commonly show evidence of heterosexism, self-censorship and even explicit condemnations of homosexuality. Yet a dissident discourse in Nigeria, as well as research from elsewhere in the region, suggests that this appearance of unity may belie greater openness to the issues than assumed. Indeed, research shows that (1) many African societies are traditionally more accommodating toward non-normative sexualities than contemporary nationalist or cultural claims would allow, and (2) secretive 'bisexuality' is more common in practice (and tacitly acknowledged) than previously understood. Is it possible then that the presumption of homophobia and the fear of backlash that has clearly contributed to heterosexism and selfcensorship in scholarship around homosexualities in Nigeria are exaggerated? Is it possible that Nigerians may be more open to consideration of scientific evidence and international best practices around sexual diversity, rights, and health than is commonly assumed in the literature? A trial intervention at a small state university in a predominantly rural area of Nigeria tested these questions by introducing wide-ranging, frank and non-judgemental (science-based) discussions of same-sex sexuality in several classes. Analysis of the students' feedback finds that stigmatising attitudes toward homosexuality were indeed present among the students. However, there was also a high degree of curiosity, awareness of the existence of secretive homosexualities in Nigeria, desire for education, and confidence that traditional cultures and Nigerian democracy could accommodate individual freedom and sexual rights. The conclusion is that well-prepared researchers and educators could be less anxious and self-censoring around the topic of homosexuality than prevails at present. Careful attention would need to be paid to local sensibilities, but sexuality and HIV education programmes could probably be brought closer into line with world guidelines on best practices and comprehensive approaches to human sexuality education and sexual health. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Development studies; Difference and diversity; Higher education; Inclusive education; Participatory methods; Queer theory; Sexualities education",,"Epprecht, M.; Department of Global Development Studies, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada; email: marc.epprecht@queensu.ca",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960868831

This necessitated their initial adoption of an authoritarian administrative style, which they eventually adapt into a more empathetic style.

To date, very little research has explored mothers' perspectives on how child protection services (CPS) actually investigates and intervenes in families where intimate partner violence (IPV) as well as child abuse or neglect have occurred. The current research explores the complex role of information and resources in child protection investigations and interventions. In-person interviews were conducted with 19 mothers who had been battered and who had been involved with CPS because of the violence. Mothers reported difficulties in sharing information with and receiving information from CPS workers, but some also reported benefiting from information they received.

Although men's emotional (e. g. shame and anxiety) and behavioural reactions (e. g. aggression) to gender-threatening feedback have been documented (Vandello et al. 2008), potential cognitive and self-regulatory consequences ""of this form of harassment have yet to be investigated. In the present experiment, 84 Introductory Psychology men at a Canadian university (Winnipeg, Manitoba) either experienced or did not experience gender-role harassment (i. e. told they squeezed a handgrip 'like a girl') before completing a set of tests (an anagram test, a stroop color-naming task, and a subsequent handgrip task). To ensure our experimental manipulation invoked a threat to participant's sense of manliness, we also included an open-ended measure of self-identification. In accordance with Social Identity research (Ellemers, Spears, & Doosje, 2002), we anticipated that harassed men would affirm male self-aspects significantly more so than non-harassed men. Overall, results demonstrated that, as predicted, gender-role harassment significantly threatened participant's sense of manhood, compromised cognitive ability, and weakened attentional self-control compared to the no harassment control condition. However, contrary to predictions, harassment did not weaken self-regulatory physical strength: men in the harassment condition exhibited increased handgrip strength compared to men in the no harassment condition, suggesting potential compensatory reactions occurred, as well. Implications of gender-role harassment for men's psychological well-being, intellect, and impulse control are discussed and areas for future research are outlined. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender-role harassment; Gender-role strain; Masculinity threat; Self-regulation",,"Werhun, C.

Viewing clips featuring a female protagonist who was both aggressive and stereotypically attractive led to greater endorsement of stereotypically feminine and stereotypically masculine gender role expectations for women. The effect on endorsement of stereotypically masculine expectations was partially mediated by the perception that the protagonist was a good role model for women. Although women endorsed both feminine and masculine gender role expectations for women more strongly than men, the effects of exposure to aggressive, attractive, female protagonists were similar for both male and female participants.

We hypothesized that women in traditional relationship contexts would express their anger less directly, and would suppress their anger more, due to expected negative social appraisals. We compared anger reactions to a conflict situation in a traditional and egalitarian relationship context. Eighty-two Dutch adult participants (43 women and 39 men) were recruited partly by students in a psychology class, and partly by a snowball method. They were invited to participate only if they had a steady relationship of minimally one year. The results show that women report more intense subjective anger in both contexts, but that the expression of anger differed with relationship context. In traditional relationships women tend to suppress their anger more than men, while men report to express their anger directly more than women. This difference in anger expression was mediated by negative social appraisals. In egalitarian relationships, this difference was not found. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Anger; Gender; Relationship context; Social appraisal",,"Fischer, A.

Prompted by findings from the American Psychological Association Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls (APA 2007), the present study considers girls' clothing as a possible socializing influence that may contribute to the development of self-objectification in preteen girls. Accordingly, in this content analysis, we examined the frequency and nature of ""sexualizing"" clothing available for girl children (generally sizes 6-14) on the websites of 15 popular stores in the US. Sexualizing clothing was defined as clothing that revealed or emphasized a sexualized body part, had characteristics associated with sexiness, and/or had sexually suggestive writing. Clothing was also coded for childlike characteristics, such as child-like fabric (e. g., polka dot pattern) or a modest, non-revealing cut. Across all stores and all articles of clothing, 69% of the clothing items were coded as having only childlike characteristics, 4% as having only sexualizing characteristics, 25. 4% as having both sexualizing and childlike characteristics, and 1% as having neither sexualizing nor childlike characteristics.

This difference might occur because women are taught to be more sensitive to emotional and nonverbal cues at a very early age compared to men. As a consequence, women might use a more favorable cognitive processing style than men during nonverbal decoding. The present study investigated whether this gender difference is due to the use of different cognitive information processing styles (global or local). Participants (N = 137) were Swiss undergraduate students that were randomly assigned to either a global (focusing on the whole) or a local (focusing on details) priming of information processing style, or to a control group. They then performed a nonverbal decoding task. Results showed that compared to the control group, local priming had beneficial and global priming detrimental effects for nonverbal decoding accuracy. This was due to an improved performance in men after the local priming; women's performance was not significantly affected by the local priming. Global priming increased nonverbal decoding accuracy in men and decreased performance in women. We conclude that women already use the more beneficial local processing style by default and that men's performance can be boosted when providing them a processing strategy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender; Information processing; Nonverbal decoding",,"Schmid, P.

However, notwithstanding the importance of this area, little information exists about women entrepreneurs' business practices, survival and growth strategies and their perceptions of entrepreneurial careers; indeed, many questions remain unanswered. To address this gap, this study aims to explore some of these questions by considering women entrepreneurs in Arab countries, more specifically, women's entrepreneurship activities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a country with unwritten social mores in a patriarchal, male dominant society. The key objective is to examine these women's personal characteristics, motivation factors, business challenges and perception on entrepreneurial behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – Because of the lack of statistical data and difficulties conducting studies in an Arabic society, this study employed a qualitative research methodology. The research comprised 19 in-depth interviews with Saudi women entrepreneurs who were identified through referrals from the Women's Section of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Findings – The Saudi women entrepreneurs were found to exhibit many similarities with their counterparts in other Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region countries in terms of their personality traits. However, they differed in other aspects such as their educational backgrounds and the manner in which they acquired entrepreneurial skills. The findings suggest some strategies to contribute to greater success rates for women entrepreneurs in Islamic countries, where entrepreneurial activities are nascent but growing. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of the study is the restricted locale of the sample. A more extensive study is needed and future research should be more diverse – including widening the selection of respondents, industries and countries. Practical implications – The paper shows that women's entrepreneurial activities in KSA are important to economic and social development. Saudi women's entrepreneurship, properly harnessed, has great potential as a tool for transforming the economy. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature on gender-related business barriers due to the scarcity of publications about women's economic activities in the MENA region, specifically in KSA. The paper is also valuable for policy makers in KSA and researchers wishing to pursue indigenous entrepreneurship and gender studies. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Saudi Arabia; Women",,"Zamberi Ahmad, S.; Marketing and Management Department, Prince Sultan University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

However, like many other nations, Ireland is lagging behind in terms of a co-ordinated approach to the specific challenge of supporting women-owned ventures, hence possibly reducing their opportunity to act as economic agents. Based on a review of growth-oriented support programmes for women in business in Ireland, this short viewpoint seeks to identifiy a number of gaps in the current support system and to propose a range of possible alternative intervention strategies that the authors believe can help facilitate business growth. Design/methodology/approach – Using secondary data, a review of the current government support programmes was carried out. Further, evidence obtained through an in-depth qualitative study of 33 women entrepreneurs in Ireland and Northern Ireland which identified a number of specific barriers inhibiting the development of these firms was used. Findings – The analysis of current government practices revealed that whilst women are making progress in starting more businesses in Ireland, the current statistics indicate that they still tend to start small and stay small. This points towards a need to reassess and understand the issue of growth among women entrepreneurs and, in doing so, develop new mechanisms that can have real impact on growth-oriented women-owned firms whilst also respecting and supporting those who choose not to grow their business. The qualitative study identified a number of specific barriers, which hinder the development of their firms. These included financial, regulatory and employability challenges; a lack of management skills and confidence. Motherhood and personal goals were also found to be inhibiting factors for women entrepreneurs. Practical implications – The paper proposes a number of possible government and personal intervention strategies to overcome the identified barriers. These include encouraging lending within the small growth sectors, conducting a regional skills audit, reducing the administration and paperwork associated with trading and accessing support and develop customised training and up-skilling designed to meet the specific needs of women entrepreneurs. Originality/value – The paper argues that government agencies in Ireland must now act on the evidence provided and confront the issues affecting women entrepreneurs. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business development; Entrepreneurs; Ireland; Women",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

These are the women who are involved in small firms but who are not copreneurs, and who do not have clearly acknowledged and/or formalised roles. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on data collected as part of a research programme that involved 250 in-depth interviews carried out with owner-managers in manufacturing and service firms throughout New Zealand over a two-year period. Findings – The findings from the interviews suggest that there are many women playing critical roles in New Zealand small firms whose contributions are unacknowledged, and which may be also unseen and unpaid. These women (typically as wives of owner-managers) are contributing invaluably to the futures and fortunes of those firms – albeit from “behind the scenes”.

Family policies are defined to include maternity/paternity leave, benefits, childcare and leave to take care of sick children. The aim of this paper is to increase awareness and elucidate the impact of welfare policies on women's entrepreneurship because it may impact on women's entrepreneurial behaviour. Hence, it seeks to investigate the reasons underlying this apparent anomaly so that future policies in Scandinavia and Europe may be tailored to suit the needs of female entrepreneurs. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses publicly available statistical data combined with unique survey data from a sample of 1,000 sole proprietors (men and women), all members of the Danish Association for the Self-employed, to identify the problems encountered by female entrepreneurs. The survey findings are illustrated with three interviews with female entrepreneurs that have been published in the Danish newspapers discussing the problems encountered by self-employed female entrepreneurs. Findings – Even though the various Scandinavian models provide for ample maternity leave, benefits and childcare, on the whole, the Nordic Welfare Model is too heavily grounded in the ideals of employment favouring employment over entrepreneurship. For example, in Denmark, a sole proprietor is not allowed to work whilst on maternity leave. If she does so, her maternity allowance is reduced. This may be tantamount to closing the business down if you have a child, and may account for the fact that women are generally much older than men when starting a business. The majority of women in the survey are critical of the maternity leave system and 30 percent perceive the childcare system as a significant barrier to starting a business. Research limitations/implications – Future research needs to compare the Danish evidence with that from other Nordic countries to establish whether the problem is restricted to Denmark. Additionally, research should focus on identifying whether child-bearing and -rearing influences on the age at which women start a business. Originality/value – So far, it has been taken for granted that the initiation of public childcare would facilitate increased entrepreneurship among women. This study shows that this is not necessarily so, and that there is a schism between welfare models that facilitate employment and those that facilitate entrepreneurship. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Denmark; Entrepreneurialism; Maternity leave; Welfare; Women",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

More specifically, it analyzes the reception of daytime American soap operas by women in the Black Sea Region of Turkey. Employing an interdisciplinary methodology that combines ethnography, textual analysis and transnational feminist theory, this study investigates how women's media experiences allow them to resist their traditional roles assigned by Islamic patriarchies. Among the major questions addressed are, ""In what ways does soap viewership reflect the appropriation of anti-patriarchal modes of knowledge? How do soap operas allow women to question local gender norms? How, for example, does viewer identification with a female soap opera character committing adultery disrupt traditional gender norms, in which an act of adultery may lead to an honor killing?"" Turkish women's viewership habits as well as their pleasures from the anti-traditional plots contribute to the creation of a resistive female sphere. This study illustrates the multiple levels through which this female forum is socially constructed. I argue that women's viewing pleasures and the actualization of a powerful female homosociality furnish the structural conditions under which alternative forms of meaning can gain a public momentum. Although respondents' diverse uses of soap operas do not represent the formation of organized feminist protest, they, nevertheless, reflect these women's dissatisfaction with the status quo. As such, soap viewership allows women to challenge traditional norms of gender and sexuality in the villages where this study was conducted. © 2011 Brill.","media ethnography; popular culture; resistance; Rural Turkish women audiences; soap operas; transnational feminist theory; viewing pleasures",,"Onaran, A.

While the depiction and the representation of the slave body have generated a great deal of debate among scholars working on slavery in the New World, this subject has received little attention amongst both Islamicists and Africanists. The literature on slavery in the American South and in the Caribbean has shown that the depiction of the slave body reveals a great deal about the reality of slavery, the relations of power and control, and the cultural codes that existed within the slave societies. The slave physical appearance and gestures were used to distinguish between the slaves and free and to justify slavery. Throughout the Americas slaves were routinely branded as a form of identification right up to the eighteenth century. Although the body of the slaves from both sexes was subjected to the same depiction, the treatment of female slaves deserves further exploration. As many scholars have argued, slave women suffer the double jeopardy of being both a slave and a woman. Moreover, the body of the female slave in Muslim societies is of particular significance as many of them were used for sexual purposes, as mistresses and concubines. The chapter shows that the reproductive role of female slaves became a major justice issue, particularly in their struggle for freedom. © 2011 Brill.","Concubines; Fatwas; Nawazil; Sharia; Slave defects; Ulama and slaves",,"Sikainga, A.

A gender-based Dual deprivation is defined, analyzed and diagnosed as vicious and multi-layered circles surrounding women's abilities to make decisions concerning their own lives on the one hand, and restricting their capacity to delve into established institutional mechanism of decision making, on the other hand. This ""dual deprivation"" not only isolates women from decision-making processes, even on issues directly impacting their lives, but also denies them the ability to act as agents of change and create an empowering environment, due to women's absence from decision-making positions. Other challenges addressed include high fertility rates, circumcision, early marriage, domestic violence, and inequitable laws. Employing testimonial interviews with women from various countries in the Arab World, the data offer in-depth analysis of the status of men and women, in relation to decision making in the private and public spheres in Arab societies. Findings show some progress despite its insufficiency, confirming that authority is still patriarchal in Arab countries. The study also shows that as opposed to men, women tend to be more participatory and democratic in their decision-making processes, veering towards ending conflict and favoring dialogue.

Taha, the elderly Islamic, modernist reformer executed by President Nimerie in 1985, to abolish legislation against female circumcision imposed by the British. Although revered as a martyr for his courage facing death for his beliefs, Taha has been unrelentingly castigated for opposing a measure that intended allegedly to rescue women from this barbarous custom. Not even Taha's subsequent unprecedented labor for women's rights took the edge off this criticism of his stand on female circumcision in 1946. The paper will argue that this conflicted view about Tahas' feminist legacy arose from a sorrowful dichotomy in scholarship about the Sudan. The culturally sensitive feminist writings about female circumcision in the country failed to influence the narrative of Sudanese nationalism. In this narrative colonial modernity's claim to civilize the ""natives"" (like rescuing colonial women from their male oppressors) has been widely accepted. Worse, this rescue mission is currently missed and nostalgically remembered as a golden past by both scholars and laymen who were turned off by the disarray of independent Sudan. Drawing on postcolonialism, the paper will seek to bridge the gulf between Sudan feminism and nationalism scholarships to rehabilitate the feminist outlook and praxis of Taha, a consummate, different nationalist. The colonial rescue concept, or modernity, will be viewed as a form of a ""colonial nonsense"" as developed by Homi Bhabha. This nonsense is an evidence of the sterility of colonialism, an alleged modernist project, torn between the demands of the metropolis raised in the custom of democracy, and the administrative constraints of the colony mired in the custom of power. © 2011 Brill.","civilizing mission; colonial knowledge; colonial modernization; colonial nonsense; colonialism; female circumcision; gender; imperial feminists; indigenous practice; Marxism; modern and tradition; other nationalisms; post-colonialism",,"Ibrahim, A.

He shows that the preponderance of Democratic identification among women is partly a function of the measurement of party identification. When respondents were asked ""Do you feel that you are"" rather than, more traditionally, ""Do you think of yourself as"" a Democrat or Republican, the sex gap narrowed to statistical nonsignificance. Burden's explanation for this result lies in the psychology of partisanship. The traditional ""think of yourself as"" (or cognitive) question primes women to consider their partisanship as a social identity, which in turn activates the stereotypical association between women and the Democratic Party. The ""feel that you are"" (or affective) question encourages a deeper, more personalized response, rendering social identity less relevant and thereby nullifying the effect of that stereotype. © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Johns, R.; Politics at the University of EssexUnited Kingdom; email: rajohn@essex.ac.uk",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

In crimes of passion, criminal responsibility is mitigated because the perpetrator was in the grip of a strong emotion -in other words, not in his or her right mind. The legal concept of passion is, therefore, society's formal recognition of the limits of reason as a basis for social behavior. Feminist scholarship has long argued that reason in law is not neutral but reflects dominant social interests. Less attention has been given to passion as reason's recognized opposite. It might be expected that the law's partial toleration of passion would privilege different interests. But this is not the case; in effect, although passion is reason's opposite, its construction in law reflects the same dominant values. Recent efforts to eradicate gender disparities in criminal law have led to some reconsideration of the construction of reason and the recognition of passion in some systems. © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Warrick, C.; Political Science at Villanova University, Villanova, PA 19085, United States; email: catherine.warrick@villanova.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

But the literature is uncertain about how candidate gender interacts with candidate party affiliation to shape voters' perceptions. In this article, I draw on political psychology, the women and politics literature, and recent work on partisan ""trait ownership"" to suggest that the application of gender stereotypes will be limited by the salience of partisan stereotypes. I use nationally representative survey data and a content analysis of news coverage from the 2006 U.S. Senate elections to test the argument. Focusing on voter evaluations of candidate traits, I find that party stereotypes are more powerful than gender stereotypes, and that assessments of candidate attributes can be affected by news coverage when candidates are portrayed in ways that challenge traditional partisan images. The results suggest that gender stereotyping is limited by the relevance of party stereotypes, and that as the Republican and Democratic parties continue to polarize at the elite level, the importance of partisan stereotyping is likely to increase. © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Hayes, D.; School of Public Affairs, American University, Washington, DC 20016, United States; email: dhayes@american.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

Causal mechanisms connecting women voters to women candidates are gender consciousness, desire for descriptive representation, support for liberal social policy, the use of gender as a shortcut to vote choice among low-information voters, and a ""party-sex overlap."" Existing work is focused on American elections, which tend to be candidate centered, so little is known about gender affinity effects between voters and candidates in other contexts. This article focuses on Westminster-style parliamentary systems, using the Canadian federal elections of 2000 and 2004 as test cases. Women in these systems have the same motivations to gravitate toward women candidates, for they are gender conscious and desire descriptive representation. But they do not have the same incentives to cast ballots for women because political institutions and practices tend to discourage candidate-based voting. The article pays particular attention to a segment of the electorate we call ""flexible"" voters, which is comprised of independents, leaners, and defectors.

Increased condom use stems from the Kenyan government's expanding HIV/AIDS programs to the remote parts of northern Kenya, resulting in easier access to condoms. This paper employs a modified reasoned action approach model to analyze 2009 survey data to understand how Ariaal sexual culture adapts to this policy. Univariate analysis indicates that for unmarried men and women, condom use is more strongly linked to premarital fertility prevention than HIV/AIDS protection, reflecting the long-standing Ariaal proscriptive norm against pre-marital fertility. Multiple regression and path analysis show gender-specific pathways to condom use, reflecting established and emergent sexual behavior. For women, significant pathways include the ability to obtain condoms and to refuse sex without condoms. For men, social norms and beliefs/attitudes including concern for their sexual partners are important pathways. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Condoms; Kenya; Pre-marital sexuality; Reasoned action approach",,"Roth, E.A.; Department of Anthropology, University of Victoria, P.O.

However, most research on managers' implementation of these policies has been conducted in liberal welfare states and ignores the impact of institutional context. In this study, we situate managers within specific workplace and national layers of context. We investigated how managers in financial organizations in the Netherlands, UK, and Slovenia talk about the utilization of worklife policies. Managers' discourses stressed disruption and dependency considerations in these case studies, as in the US research. However, a further management discourse of the moral case or right thing to do also emerged. The lack of resources for replacing staff on leave creates disruption and reduces managers capability to support the use of worklife policies, even when they are statutory or if managers are inclined be supportive (dependency or moral argument).

We argue that it is important to go beyond a state-level comparison and focus on the policy implemented by employers at the organizational level. We use a European survey to identify which employers permit their employees to make individual-level adjustments between full-time and part-time working, and the firm-level characteristics associated with operating such a policy. The analysis reveals that employer policy varies markedly across countries and within countries and we argue that this is an important social conversion factor which shapes the capability which an individual employee has to adjust their hours between full time and part time at their place of work. State policy clearly matters, but firm-level characteristics and other situational features also impact on the social conversion factors which shape an individuals working-time capability. The sector, establishment size, presence of a trade union, gender and skill composition of the workforce all had a significant influence on whether employers permitted individual-level working-time adjustments. The firms organizational working-time practices and culture toward safeguarding worklife balance had an additional and independent effect, as did broader aspects of working-time scheduling in place. © The Author 2011.

Using a unique qualitative survey conducted in two cities, Budapest and Stockholm, we analyze how mothers and fathers subjectively experience the tensions between family and work demands, and their possibilities for alternative choices (agency freedom). We find similarities in these tensions involving time pressure and time poverty, cutting across gender and education. Our Hungarian parents, nevertheless, experience greater agency inequalities for WLB, which reflect weaker institutional resources (conversion factors) as well as cultural/societal norms that act as constraints for WLB claims in the workplace and household.

Following the conceptual framework of Amartya Sen, we examine how job-related demands and resources are related to the level of interference, as well as satisfaction with managing work and home in Spanish and German employees, using three different large-scale European surveys: European Quality of Life Survey and two waves of the European Social Survey. We find that long working hours systematically increase tensions between work and home, as do time pressure, job-related stress, and working hard. Job control or autonomy at work, which is hypothesized to expand individuals capabilities and agency, tends to increase workhome interference rather than alleviate it. Family responsibilities and household demands do not seem relevant to the tensions employees experience at the workhome interface. This also holds true for women, which is a surprising result in view of the ""double burden"" hypothesis. Employed mothers in Germany and Spain are a select group of women, as combining employment with raising children in conservativecorporatist and conservativefamilialist states may be particularly problematic. Thus while the institutional contexts of Germany and Spain curtail womens ability to reconcile employment and parenthood, the mothers (and fathers) who are employed do not experience significantly higher levels of workfamily/home tensions than nonparents. © The Author 2011.

Focusing on the stage of young adulthood when many imagined potential homes elsewhere but in the event found themselves making homes for themselves in Ireland, this article considers the re-making of self and home in the absence of migrant family members and friends. Family, friendship and community relations have to be reappraised as those who stay wait in the mode of hope for a liveable outcome, or life plan. This is 'waiting-as-event' or 'active waiting'; being alive to the world and the possibilities for making a future. Waiting here is a social norm or aspect of the established family and community relations which, in 1950s Ireland, involved negotiating over time who was to stay and who was to emigrate. The narratives constitute women as women and men as men through relationships to potential migration and associated everyday temporalities of waiting mediated by family obligation (in relation to gendered norms of inheritance, caring and negotiations of autonomy). Moreover, the unpredictability of the outcome of waiting and coming to terms with staying produces unexpected self-encounters in the familiar place of a home changed by the absence of others, but also by their presence in new ways via letters, remittances, return visits and potential return. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Gender; Ireland; Migrant; Motility; Non-migrant; Waiting","cultural tradition; family structure; gender issue; modernity; motility; population migration; Ireland","Gray, B.; Department of Sociology, University of Limerick, Castletroy, Limerick, Ireland; email: breda.gray@ul.ie",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957527533

They wait in limbo, their status unresolved in what the United Nations (UN) calls 'protracted refugee situations' (PRS). The material conditions and depictions of such refugees as immobile and passive contributes to a feminization of asylum in such spaces. In contrast, refugees on the move to seek asylum in the global North are perceived as threats and coded as part of a masculinist geopolitical agenda that controls and securitizes their movement. Policies to externalize asylum and keep potential refugees away from the affluent nations of the global North, in which they may seek legal status, represent one strategy of exclusion. This article traces these divergent trajectories of im/mobility and demonstrates how humanitarian space for both groups is narrowing over time. For those seeking asylum in the global North, measures such as increased detention and rapid return to transit countries aim to deter migrants from arriving at all. It is contended that the discrete systems that manage asylum seekers in the global North and refugees in long-term limbo are themselves gendered. European Union policies to 'externalize' asylum and keep asylum seekers offshore dovetail with policies by EU member states to 'build capacity' for refugee protection in refugee 'regions of origin'. These represent a shifting, not a sharing, of responsibility for their welfare and prolongs their wait. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Externalization of asylum; Feminization of refugees; Protracted refugee situations; Waiting","asylum seeker; European Union; feminization; geopolitics; refugee; United Nations","Hyndman, J.; Centre for Refugee Studies, York University, 8th Floor York Research Tower, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; email: jhyndman@yorku.ca",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957522897

Over the last 20 years, films by both French and French-Maghrebi filmmakers determined to show the reality of life on the outskirts of France's major cities have paradoxically helped reinforce notions of the grands ensembles as places outside the mainstream of culture and identity. In her movie Jeunesse Dorée (2002), filmmaker Zaïda Ghorab-Volta uses the simple narrative of a road trip made by two young working-class women around France photographing these ensembles to subvert various forms of discursive emplacement that have resulted from the convergence between inhuman built environments and filmic representations of those environments that exploit ethnic difference and glamorize masculine violence. Although the film recognizes the incarcerative nature of these modernist neighbourhoods for women, it does not mediate a simplistic rejection of the banlieu. Instead, Jeunesse Dorée proposes a working class solidarity that cuts across place, race and gender, and a relationship between (urban) modernity and (geographical) citizenship that reworks mainstream French ways of thinking about urban culture and the space of nationhood. The young women's project of 'framing modernity' also works within the film as a mise en abyme, recuperating high modernist theories of mediated vision as a primary link between cities and their hinterlands. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Film de banlieue; Gender; Landscape; National identity; Urbanism","citizenship; cultural identity; ethnicity; gender identity; modernity; national identity; neighborhood; race; urban area; violence; womens status; France","Foster, J.; Cornell University, Landscape Architecture, Kennedy Hall, Ithaca, United States",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957515392

Drawing from interviews with farmers situated in a metropolitan region of the USA, it argues that these women's motivations are expressive of an ethics of care that defines their work as centered upon nourishing themselves and others. Women came to this work as a conscious choice to change their life-work. These choices are shaped by the urban context of their farming practices and also by their race and middle class status. These motivations and choices express a care ethics centered in self-care. Drawing from Foucault's ethics of self-care, these motivations express a liberatory transformation of self that is also radically responsible to others and expressive of a post-capitalist politics. These ethically informed agricultural practices correspond to the development of a post-capitalist politics that challenges neoliberal subject formation in food production and consumption. Feminist care ethics contributes to feminist political ecology by focusing upon the social relations of caring practice, and also revealing how self-care is ethically embodied and politically transformative in the case of middle class urban farmers active in community supported agriculture. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Care ethics; Political ecology; Sustainable agriculture","agricultural practice; agricultural worker; alternative agriculture; class; ethics; food consumption; food production; metropolitan area; race; womens status; United States","Jarosz, L.; Department of Geography, University of Washington, Box 353550, Seattle, WA 98118, United States; email: jarosz@u.washington.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957440160

Additionally, this study seeks to determine if gender serves as a predictor or moderator variable in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaires were used to collect data from 169 working adults enrolled in evening business programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The sample was split evenly between female (82) and male (81) respondents. Six respondents did not provide their gender classification. Stepwise hierarchical moderated regression analysis was used to test the effects of competitiveness and gender as predictor and moderator variables in relation to the ethicality of negotiation strategies. Findings: The results show that while men are more generally competitive than women, both men and women who score highly on the hypercompetitive scale are more likely to embrace the use of unethical bargaining behavior. However, women with high scores on personal development competitiveness (PDC) are more likely to engage in accepted bargaining behavior than are men. It was also found that there is a positive relationship between PDC and the use of acceptable, normative bargaining behavior (NBB) for both women and men. Research limitations/implications: There is the question of generalizability since the subjects were virtually all between ages 24 and 34. In addition, they live in the same metropolitan area and attend the same southern US private university. Originality/value: This study provides a clearer understanding of the differences between women and men competitively and as negotiators. It also provides prima facie evidence for the value of women as preferred organizational negotiators, since under certain conditions, they are more likely than men to use acceptable, NBB. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Competitive strategy; Ethics; Gender; Negotiating; United States of America",,"Arendall, C.

The study population consisted of 11,471 persons in 46 companies working in the computer sector, and 32,151 individuals in 77 companies employed in the grocery production sector. Findings: The results show indices of 1.43-2.09 for the computer sector and of 1.13-2.14 for the grocery production sector, both with a normal distribution (one is considered fully gender equal and three least gender equal). Added together, the selected variables provide results that are sufficiently different to enable ranking. The variables vary in importance in the two sectors compared. The smallest index variation was for education and salaries; the largest was for parental leave and the number of men and women employed at the companies.

The results are based on a 2009 national web panel survey among 16-24 year-olds in Norway (n = 871). Most respondents reported having met their most recent sex partner via friends or family, and 62% referred to the sex partner as a sweetheart. One out of two claimed they had not used condoms during the first sexual intercourse with this partner. A factor analysis revealed 2-D of motivation for not using condoms, referred to here as 'Fear of Suspicion' and 'Mutual Trust'. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that, when controlled for gender, age, and number of sex partners in one's life, 'Mutual Trust' had a statistically significant relationship to coital frequency and the number of years coitally active. None of the predictor variables had a statistically significant relationship with ""Fear of Suspicion"". The most commonly reported motives for the most recent sexual intercourse were having been 'sexually aroused' and 'in love'. A total of 56% reported using hormonal contraception, while 20% used condoms. The most important reasons for not using condoms were: 'used other contraception', 'did not worry about STIs', 'more pleasurable without', 'had none available', and 'unprepared for intercourse'.

The research was carried out at a residential outdoor centre as part of a PhD study and a follow-up pilot project. The participants were primary school pupils, their teachers and the centre staff. For the purpose of this article, the term 'teacher' is used to refer to both visiting teachers accompanying the school groups and the centre staff. This research was eclectic. It took an ethnographic approach using participant observation and semistructured interviews to collect a variety of data. Ethnography was considered as the most appropriate for this research because it puts an emphasis on understanding the perceptions and cultures of the people and organisations studied. The findings of the research have shown that, on occasion, teachers take a controlling approach when facilitating outdoor activities in order to manage the perceived risk of being in the outdoors. This tended to result in the disempowerment of the children and put the teachers in a position of power, which had serious implications for the pupils' learning experience. By giving the children specific instructions, and mainly focusing on maintaining discipline during the activities, teachers do not allow their pupils to workout how to deal with risk.

This article illustrates in relation to one of the subject departments a complex analysis of teacher education and development that does more than put the individual student teacher at the centre of the frame as they learn 'on the job'. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Cultural and historical activity theory; Ethnographic methodology; School subject departments",,"Douglas, A.

It is interesting to work with police data due to high stress levels and the male dominated work environment. This paper explores both gender differences in (perceived) stress levels as well as the underlying gender-specific sensitivity to environmental factors, such as unit cooperation, trust in the work partner, higher levels of work-lifebalance and home stability, and interactional fairness. Using multivariate regression analysis we find that female officers are significantly more likely to report physical strains than males, while no gender differences are observable in regards to psychological strains. Moreover, higher levels of trust and interactional fairness at work are not able to absorb physical strain among females, but have a strong impact on males. Alternatively for both female and male officers, work-life balance and stability at home appear to reduce physical strain. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Burnout; Gender; Justice; Police officers; Stress; Work-life balance",,"Savage, D.

Groups that could not possibly succeed using conventional tactics on the battlefield employ unconventional means to strike terror behind the battle lines. Increasingly, however, the ""weakest"" members of society, notably women and children, have been drawn into the fray as operatives. Once an occasional occurrence, the use of women is growing at an alarming rate. Using female recruits provides the terrorist organizations with a comparative advantage, particularly the element of surprise. At the same time, this strategy damages the psychological well being and morale of the soldiers opposing them. Soldiers have been trained to protect the civilian population. US Army doctrine specifies that, ""preserving noncombatant lives and dignity is central to mission accomplishment in counterinsurgency"" (Lt. Col. Perez in The embedded morality in FM 3-24 Counterinsurgency, Military Review, 32) The requirement to shoot people that soldiers are ordinarily trained to protect can have deep psychological impact disproportionate to killing adult men. This often results in higher levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and battle fatigue. The upsurge in female suicide bombers has occurred across a variety of nationalistic and secular groups but has also spread to the conservative religious terror networks. This article assesses the growing phenomenon of female terrorists and looks at the different roles that women play in terrorist organizations. It also analyzes the different mechanisms for women's mobilization and briefly discusses whether women are coerced or are willing participants in terrorist violence. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Mobilization; Occupation; Rape; Suicide Bombers; Terrorism; Terrorist; Women",,"Bloom, M.; Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; email: mub27@psu.edu",,,1098092X,,,,"English","Gender Issues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957899912

At the same time, male students' presence highlights critical challenges to feminist pedagogy: gendered patterns of interaction, resistance to feminist teaching, and limitations on women's critical reflections on personal experience. When men teach WGS, typically they are ""graded up""-evaluated by students as less biased and more competent than female professors.

Its unusual characteristic lay in its incorporation in Australia's system of wage determination. This reform was advantageous to women in paid work but key ambiguities emerged as to how the right to equal pay would be claimed in areas of highly feminized work. In 1993 the right to equal pay was introduced in statute and conjoined to a test of sex discrimination, a construction that was ineffective, particularly in the context of a decentralizing wages system. State jurisdictions in Australia developed innovative responses to this impasse that were founded on the concept of undervaluation. These approaches addressed a persistent flaw in rights-based approaches, the requirement for women to demonstrate they are the same as men to claim equality. These approaches, although currently proscribed, demonstrated that particular constructions of rights-based discourses can be effective if connected to the underlying dynamics of gender pay inequity and grounded in the instruments of industry and minimum wage determination. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Equal pay; Gender mainstreaming undervaluation; Rights-based discourses","human rights; reform process; state role; wage determination; womens status; Australia","Smith, M.; School of Management, University of Western Sydney, Penrith South Distribution Centre, Locked Bag 1797, NSW, Australia; email: meg.smith@uws.edu.au",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051997874

The jewellery (primarily hand woven silver chains) is marketed nationally and internationally and the villages are linked to the domestic and the global markets through a series of subcontractors. The paper is a critical analysis and deconstruction of the gendered division of labour where women's work in chain-weaving is constructed as 'leisure activity', requiring little training and carried out at home. The women are rendered invisible as workers through the discursive practices of control over their sexuality, restricting their mobility geographically and in the job hierarchy, and earn a low average wage of INR 1.35/hour for chain-weaving. Men engage in the soldering and finishing of chains, which is constructed as 'tough', requiring long training, carried out in the visible spaces of the workshops and are paid an average wage of INR 5/hour. The discourses feed into the subjective identities of men as bread-winners and constitute women as housewives. However, women challenge the construction of chain-weaving as 'leisure'. In their affirmation of chain-weaving as 'work' they present a fragmentation to their subjective identities as housewives and navigate their paradoxical situation; an ambivalence created by what they do, how they view what they do and how they are viewed in doing it. In addition, some women cross the gendered division of labour and engage in soldering, thus challenging its construction as particularly 'tough' for women. Although how this disruption is currently negotiated mutes its resistive effect, the fact of it has created new discursive practices by which the crossing of the gendered divide is achieved. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Discourse; Ethnography; Gender division of labour; Hidden women workers; India; Subjectivity",,"Soni-sinha, U.; McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, KTH 704, Hamilton, Ontario L8S 4M4, Canada; email: urvashi@mcmaster.ca",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

We argue that there is a need to scrutinize both the level of democracy as well as the level of masculine hegemony in societies. Methodologically, we use a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses to support our argument. We employ regression analysis to show that the relationship between the extent of democracy and the representation of women in politics appears, at first glance, to be non-existent but turns out to be a curvilinear one. We also show that democracy can facilitate peace, but only in interaction with the level of political gender equality, so that more democratic societies are more peaceful only if there have been moves to gender equality. Our interpretation of these findings is illustrated by the contemporary politics of Thailand. Recent political violence in southern Thailand can be accounted for in the context of it being only partly democratized, where a culture of militarized masculinity persists alongside with, and even within, democratic institutions. Such a culture makes it both difficult for women to enter the political sphere, despite democratic elections, and fosters political violence. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Conflict; Democratization; Gender; Militarized masculinities; Peace; Thailand",,"Bjarnegård, E.; Department of Government, Uppsala University, Box 514, 751 20 Uppsala, Sweden; email: Elin.Bjarnegard@statsvet.uu.se",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

This paper challenges the binary approach, and instead analyzes the categorization of gender as created in Swedish newspaper stories about alcohol, published between 2000 and 2008. Specific categories examined include 'responsible mothers', 'responsible parents', 'party girls', 'career women with drinking problems', 'violent men who drink' and 'beer-drinking, sexist male athletes'. Based on this examination, the paper discusses how the media stories do and/or undo gender and how they encourage readers to act by the categories of drinkers that they describe. The study shows that the Swedish media stories produce multiple ways of interpreting drinking. Some of the stories undo gender through linking 'male' behavior (drinking heavily) to female bodies, while others undo gender by treating parenthood as more important than gender. Importantly, however, other stories reproduce the discourse of heteronormativity and gender binarism. The study suggests that analyses of media texts need to take the complexity of 'undoing gender' into account, for example by avoiding the assumption that gender is either undone or reproduced. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Alcohol; Discourse; Doing/undoing gender; Media; Policy; Sweden",,"Bogren, A.; SoRAD (Centre for Social Research on Alcohol and Drugs), Stockholm University, SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden; email: alexandra.bogren@sorad.su.se",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

These events and the negative perception of Islam have paradoxically given rise to Muslim women's public presence and paved the way for their political engagement. Their efforts, however, have been hampered by Orientalist and Islamic fundamentalist ideologies, each advancing its own constructs of Muslim women; one seeking to 'save' them and the other to 'protect' them. Muslim women have found both ideologies oppressive. As a result, they have been actively challenging these ideologies in American society at large and within their own Muslim communities. Through civic engagement and participation in Muslim organizations, these women have been making efforts to redefine themselves, claim their space, secure their rights and advance the causes of Muslim American communities. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","civic and political engagements; hate crimes; hijab; Islamic fundamentalism; Muslim; Orientalism; public space",,"Zahedi, A.; Center for Middle Eastern Studies, University of California, Berkeley, 340 Stephen Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-2314, United States; email: azahedi@berkeley.edu",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

It demonstrates that civilian victimization is directly linked to the gendered logic of the immunity principle. Particularly, we contend that civilian victimization is a logical extension of wars justified by protecting women and children, and that 'civilian' in 'civilian victimization' is a proxy for women. We make this argument in several steps. First, we introduce the literature about civilian victimization, acknowledging both its insights and its blindness to gender analysis. Second, we use feminist work on gender, war and militarism to present the case that civilian victimization in war is a product of gendered elements of the justificatory logics of war. We then provide examples of the gendered nature of civilian victimization (specifically targeting women in wars).

I employ an intersectionality framework to demonstrate how their shared and divergent experiences, presented only partially and in my narrative form, tell a tale of the intertwining consequences of this multi-billion dollar international development project in the lives of rural poor women. Women's lived experiences of the LHWP reveal the contradictions of international development, exposing the masculinist imperatives that focus on generating national revenues to the exclusion of other development options, while organizing practices that dislocate the rural poor from their lands and livelihoods and implementing policies that reinforce patriarchy locally and globally.

This, potentially, has great implications for women's reproductive history, and for the contemporary conceptualisation of abortion as a medical need.

Its object of study is an archive made up of the texts of swearing in ceremonies of newly appointed judges of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia. The texts, records of public events, demonstrate a remarkable consistency of general content and tone. They take the form of what might best be described as life writing (biography and autobiography). They have a strong hagiographic quality. Dedicated to writing the life of the newly appointed judge, they are a particular form of life writing devoted to the portrayal of state officials. As such they have a double function formulating and fashioning the subject not only as an exemplary individual life but also as a subject that embodies the virtues of the judicial institution. Each swearing-in document offers a textual portrait that makes and makes public the values and virtues of the institution of the judge. An important context for this study is an earlier empirical research project on sexual diversity in the judiciary. Key informants in that research advised me that sexuality was unlike the other strands of diversity. It was described as a personal and a private matter: strictly extra judicial. The primary objective of this essay is to explore how, if at all, sexuality is made in these public judicial ceremonies and texts, and more specifically, how the subject's sexuality is figured as an institutional ideal, as a judicial virtue. In undertaking this task the analysis will also examine some aspects of the role of gender in the formation of the judicial subject as a sexual subject. © The Author(s) 2011.","family values; homosociality; judicial virtues; sexuality",,"Moran, L.

Results indicated that feminist identity significantly predicted participants' preferences for an ideal male partner's conformity to masculine norms. Specifically, women who were more accepting of patriarchal culture, endorsing traditional gender roles and denying sexism, reported wanting an ideal male partner to conform to traditional masculine norms of emotional control, risk-taking, power over women, dominance, self-reliance, and disdain for homosexuals. In contrast, feminist-identified women reported wanting an ideal partner who did not conform to the traditional masculine norms of violence, power over women, playboy, and self-reliance. We discuss implications of these findings for women's heterosexual relationships, including the possibility that feminist identity may serve as a protective factor against involvement in unsatisfying, or even violent, romantic heterosexual relationships. © The Author(s) 2011.","feminism; human mate selection; masculinity; relationship satisfaction; sex role attitudes",,"Backus, F.

Coping strategies refer to efforts used to resolve problems and those used to manage, endure, or alleviate distress. Culture-specific strategies were examined in the current study (i.e., efforts that are commonly used by members of a cultural group). Culture-specific efforts were hypothesized to influence the severity of psychological symptoms associated with individual race-related stress, such that frequent use of culture-specific efforts would lessen the strength of the relationship between race-related stress and psychological symptoms. Moderated hierarchical regression analyses revealed that high use of ritual-centered strategies to address race-related stress was related to severe anxiety and interpersonal sensitivity. No moderating effect of coping strategies was found for depression, obsessive-compulsion, and somatization symptoms. The findings suggest that African American women may inadvertently utilize coping efforts that serve to increase the severity of psychological symptoms related to individual race-related stress. Mental health professionals should explore underlying emotions related to coping efforts utilized to address race-related stress among African American women. © The Author(s) 2011.","African American women; anxiety; coping behavior; interpersonal interaction; mental health; racism; stress",,"Greer, T.

Using data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) with its nationally representative sample of Australian women, the authors examine how women moving from their 20s to early 30s change their aspirations for employment (at the age of 35) after significant life events and changes, including the birth of a child. Multinomial logistic regression analyses across two transition periods (N = 7,505 and N = 7,584) showed that changes in employment aspirations co-occurred with movement into marriage or stable relationships and with changes in aspirations for family size. As young women become mothers, or move into situations in which motherhood is likely, many adjusted their employment aspirations away from full-time employment and toward part-time work. The findings suggest a growing awareness of the practical difficulties of balancing paid work and family roles within the current context of work and family policy and practice in Australia. Women's choices are not free of constraints; rather, younger generations of women negotiate work and family life by adjusting and changing their own aspirations within the context and circumstances of their lives. © The Author(s) 2011.","aspiration; cohort analysis; family-work relationship; occupational aspirations; work (attitudes toward); working women",,"Johnstone, M.; School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, St Lucia QLD 4072, Australia; email: uqmjohn8@uq.edu.au",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

Self-report questionnaires were used to collect information about control variables, sociodemographic (age, educational level, and work), and pregnancy variables (previous miscarriages, weeks of gestation, and planned pregnancy). Personality was measured using the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, pregnancy worries by the Cambridge Worry Scale, psychiatric clinical symptomatology using the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R), and physical symptomatology with the Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy Instrument. Significant relations were observed between pregnancy worries, the traits of agreeableness and neuroticism, and all the SCL-90-R dimensions. The analyses revealed a direct effect of neuroticism and agreeableness on pregnancy worries. Pregnancy worries mediated the effects of both neuroticism and agreeableness on interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation. Worries were found not to have mediating effects between personality and somatic symptomatology. These results suggest that neuroticism exerts a negative effect on the psychological health of pregnant women, whereas agreeableness has a positive effect (both as a direct effect and as an indirect effect mediated by pregnancy worries). These findings have important practical implications regarding the planning of health care programs for pregnant women: Specifically, health professionals must take personality into account as a potential determinant of pregnant women's health, not only for the prevention of risks (in the case of neuroticism) but also for promoting health (in the case of agreeableness). © The Author(s) 2011.","agreeableness; anxiety; neuroticism; personality traits; pregnancy; psychiatric symptoms; somatization",,"Puente, C.

Young adults read sentences that either threatened women's gender identity (in the social identity threat condition) or did not threaten this identity (in the control condition). During this sentence-reading task, participants were also asked to remember numerous neutral words. Women who were more strongly gender-identified recalled fewer of the neutral words when these words were presented in conjunction with sentences that threatened women's gender identity compared to when the words were presented with non-identity threatening sentences. More weakly gender-identified women, as well as men, did not show working memory impairments when exposed to threatening as compared to nonthreatening sentences. This study provides insight into who is most vulnerable to experiencing working memory impairments following a threat to their social identity. It also has practical implications for promoting environments that increase the likelihood that members of devalued groups can more optimally draw on their reserves of memory. For instance, workplaces that permit the expression of sexism may find that this behavior actually decreases the performance of female employees who identify with their gender group. © The Author(s) 2011.","cognitive processes; group identity; performance; sexism; social identity; threat",,"Kaiser, C.

Meta-analysis of 32 samples (16 with men, 16 with women; N = 5,459) indicated that Benevolent Sexism (BS) in women was associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners (r = 0.24), whereas Hostile Sexism (HS) in men was associated with stronger preferences for physically attractive partners (r = 0.20). Study 2 examined the ideological correlates of this gender difference (N = 249 men, 243 women). For women, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners, mediated by BS. For men, Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) was associated with greater preferences for attractive partners, mediated by HS. These findings indicate that women's desire for high-resource partners is related to a protection and security-provision motive, whereas men's desire for attractive partners is related to a dominance-based status-marker motive. Gender differences in these dual motives have implications for understanding the reciprocal reinforcement of gender inequality. We argue that they exacerbate gender inequality by decreasing women's immediate motivation for direct access to resources (because they may be provided for by men) and promoting instead goals in women relating to the maintenance of an attractive appearance valued by men. © The Author(s) 2011.","authoritarianism; dominance; dual process model; human mate selection; prejudice; romance; sexism",,"Sibley, C.

Data were obtained from five Midwestern juvenile county courts using a recently developed youth risk assessment instrument called the global risk assessment device (GRAD). In line with past research on teen pregnancy, the authors found that young African American female offenders were three times more likely to have ever been pregnant than their European American counterparts. Factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) procedures were conducted to identify the ecological risk domains that differentiated groups of female juvenile offenders in the sample of this study, based on their pregnancy history and racial background. The findings of this study suggest that female offenders who had experienced a pregnancy had significantly higher levels of health-related risks as compared to their counterparts who had never been pregnant. Furthermore, regardless of their pregnancy history, White female offenders reported significantly greater involvement in substance abuse behaviors as compared to Blacks. Taken together, these findings underscore the need to utilize comprehensive risk assessments when designing integrated intervention programs that are tailored to the unique needs of young female offenders who are at risk for early pregnancies. © The Author(s) 2011.","adolescent pregnancy; criminal justice; health behaviors; juvenile delinquency; racial differences; risk assessment; substance abuse",,"Khurana, A.; The Annenberg Public Policy Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States; email: akhurana@asc.upenn.edu",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals ""to see the unseen."" Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that men's endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce women's versus men's endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","activism; attitude change; empathy; intervention; prejudice; sexism; stereotyped attitudes",,"Becker, J.

Using an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) named the Successful Manager IAT (SM-IAT) in Study 1, we found that male participants were more likely to implicitly associate men with successful manager traits and women with unsuccessful manager traits compared to reversed pairings. Women, individuals high in internal motivation to respond without sexism, and those low in external motivation to respond without sexism showed positive implicit associations between women and successful manager traits. In contrast, all participants showed positive views of women on workplace-contextualized explicit measures of gender stereotypes. The findings of Study 2 also revealed that implicit gender stereotypes predicted hypothetical workplace outcomes, such that a greater implicit association of men with successful manager traits, and women with unsuccessful manager traits, was linked to increased workplace rewards assigned to male managers by both male and female participants. The findings of our studies have important implications for both gender stereotyping researchers and workplace practitioners. Theoretically, our studies suggest that explicit and implicit stereotypes of female managers diverge, with implicit stereotypes being more likely to highlight traditional, often negative, views of female managers. Our findings point toward a better understanding of female managers' challenges in the workplace. © The Author(s) 2011.","attitudes; employee attitudes; equity (payment); sex role attitudes; sexism; stereotyped attitudes",,"Latu, I.

Trained students had significantly lower rape myth acceptance scores than did students with no training. Trained students also reported engaging in significantly more bystander behaviors and observing more self-reported active bystander behaviors when compared with nontrained students. When comparing self-reported active bystander behavior scores of students trained with students hearing a Green Dot speech alone, the training was associated with significantly higher active bystander behavior scores. Those receiving bystander training appeared to report more active bystander behaviors than those simply hearing a Green Dot speech, and both intervention groups reported more observed and active bystander behaviors than nonexposed students. © The Author(s) 2011.","bystander strategies; campus violence; college students; prevention; sexual violence","adolescent; adult; article; attitude to health; cooperation; cross-sectional study; evaluation; female; health service; human; male; methodology; rape; self report; social behavior; social psychology; student; teaching; university; violence; Adolescent; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Helping Behavior; Humans; Male; Rape; Self Report; Social Responsibility; Social Values; Student Health Services; Students; Teaching; Universities; Violence; Young Adult","Coker, A.

Several key issues in this longstanding debate are how much external or coercive influence women experience (or acknowledge) in their choice to pursue surgery, whether they are aware of sexist ideology more so than non-recipients, and whether their choice to pursue surgery exemplifies a strong sense of self worth. To test this agency hypothesis, we draw on survey data from a volunteer sample of 202 adult women ages 19-86 years from the southern California region in the U. S. to compare cosmetic surgery recipients to non-recipients across these key socio-cultural and personal domains. Results reveal that cosmetic surgery recipients were more likely to have friends who had undergone cosmetic surgery, endorsed more covert sexist beliefs, exhibited greater media usage, and had higher household incomes, than non-recipients. Recipients also evidenced lower ratings in global self-esteem than non-recipients. These findings challenge some of the notions attendant to agency claims, and engage with conceptions of autonomy introduced in the feminist philosophical literature. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agency; Autonomy; Cosmetic surgery; Gender ideology; Media usage; Relationship influences; Self-esteem",,"Eriksen, S.; Department of Human Development, California State University, Long Beach, 1250 Bellflower Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90840, United States; email: seriksen@csulb.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957940891

Among the three cases, environmental protection and sustainable livelihood emerge as common themes. The reasons for choosing these themes are twofold. First, environmental and livelihood issues are very prominent in China, especially in the mainland, and the contribution of women to environmental protection and the improvement of livelihood has been outstanding. By contextualizing their work in their respective political, social, and economic systems in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China, respectively, we will see that peace work at the individual level does have an impact on eliminating structural and cultural violence embedded in government policies, profit-driven economic development, discrimination, and so on. Second, the fact that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Wangari Maathai in 2004, Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank in 2006, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore in 2007 is a good demonstration of the changing conceptualization of peace toward environment and livelihood issues at the global level.

The research is set in a call centre in Ireland at a time when the economy was moving from growth to recession. Design/methodology/approach – A single case study approach is taken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all eight members of senior management in Ireland and with five members of senior management based in five sites across Europe. In addition, company documentation was used. Findings – The overall findings of this study point towards the effect the economy has on the promotion and adoption of work-life balance initiatives. The findings also show that it is not possible to measure work-life balance in an absolute way, because personal circumstances influence the way this is perceived. Whilst managers with caring responsibilities have obvious work-life conflicts, the findings show that some childless managers do also, but cannot find a legitimate justification for addressing their needs. Finally, the findings show that long hours and presenteeism do form “part of the job” when accepting a role at a higher level. However, modern technology has helped this to some extent by allowing senior managers to be accessible instead of having to be present in the office. Originality/value – The paper provides new insights into aspects of managerial work which impact on work-life balance – in particular the pressure to “choose” to work long hours, the role of technology, the negative impact of traveling time, and the need for more cultural support for a better work-life balance for managers. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Call centres; Flexible working hours; Ireland; Job satisfaction; Senior management",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

In this article, we test whether essentialist beliefs regarding sexual orientation are differentially associated with sexual prejudice against gay men depending on whether these beliefs are assessed at a category level (e.g., beliefs about the biological bases of the category of sexual orientation) or a trait level (e.g., beliefs about the biological bases of stereotypical traits associated with sexual orientation). It is hypothesised that when genetic beliefs regarding the category are assessed, these beliefs should be associated with lower sexual prejudice. Conversely, when essentialist beliefs are examined on a trait level, increases in homophobia are predicted. Survey data from a sample of heterosexuals confirmed the hypotheses. Potential mediators, including the role of controllability, and implications for reducing sexual prejudice are discussed. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Essentialism; Genetic determinism; Prejudice; Sexual orientation",,"Kahn, K.

We extend this analysis in a thematic analysis to examine representations of sex in two best selling Australian women's magazines and to examine how such ideologies may reduce women's abilities to negotiate safe sex. One main theme - hetero monogamy - and six subsidiary themes emerged. Being in a monogamous heterosexual relationship was presented as essential for every woman's happiness, with sex as the means for achieving and maintaining this state. Five subsidiary themes, labelled gender differences, great sex, reaching orgasm, appearance and single women, reinforced the message that, for women, sex was work and required instruction. The final theme, sexual health, revealed an alarming absence of information on negotiating safe sex, apart from referring to it as an 'awkward conversation', whereas unprotected sex was a sign of trust and commitment. Throughout the themes, there was a lack of recognition of women's sexual desires and sexual agency. We argue that these discourses have serious implications for women's sexual health.© 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Australia; Hetero monogamy; Qualitative analysis; Safe sex; Women's magazines",,"Moran, C.; School of Psychology, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; email: c.moran1@uq.edu.au",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

The results indicate a wide range of common and experimental sexual practices in Second Life, with sexual involvement occurring at faster pace and with a larger number of partners than in real life. In addition, these sexual practices occur in a range of relationship contexts, from brief casual encounters to long-term commitment and virtual marriage. Participants were evenly split on which realm was more sexually satisfying, with many participants indicating that sexuality in Second Life offers greater freedom and less inhibition than in real life. Participants also tended to view the two domains of sexual experience as largely independent, with sexuality in one realm having little effect on sexuality in the other.

Indeed, psychological violence is much more prevalent than physical violence in couples, and its impact can be just as devastating. Research has recently begun to address psychological aggression in same-sex couples, but the most commonly used questionnaire for assessing intimate partner violence has yet to be fully validated with this population. The two objectives of the present study are (1) to present the first data on the psychometric properties of the psychological aggression scale of the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CST2; Straus, Hamby, Boney- McCoy, & Sugarman, 1996) with individuals in same-sex couple relationships, and (2) to examine the relationship between psychological aggression and physical violence in this population. Two hundred eighteen individuals (75 men and 143 women) participated in this study. Results support the factor structure, reliability, and concurrent validity of the psychological aggression scale. Rates of psychological and physical violence are reported, and results indicate that psychological aggression is strongly correlated with physical violence in same-sex couples.

Most important, the families that these men form are continually found to be supportive and positive environments in which to raise children. Yet despite these positive findings, other empirical evidence from examinations of popular media representations of gay parents highlights the negative assumptions that continue to be perpetuated against gay men who are parents. More specifically, these findings suggest that print and popular media promote an account of gay parents that is often either normalising or pathologising. The findings presented in this article extend this latter body of research by exploring filmic portrayals of gay men variously engaged in fostering and adoptive arrangements. Through an analysis of five recently released films, four dominant themes are elaborated: (1) the capacity of gay men to parent and under what circumstances; (2) the relationship between gay men's sexual identities and their identity as parents; (3) the agency of children who are cared for by gay men; and (4) constructions of kinship in the films. Implications are explored for what these themes tells us about the representations of gay men deemed acceptable or intelligible at present, and the identities the films offer to gay parent viewers. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Children of gay adoptive parent; Children of gay foster parent; Film representations; Gay adoptive father; Gay father; Gay foster father",,"Riggs, D.

Research limitations/implications: A potential limitation of this study is that all participants were distance-learning students, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Furthermore, cross-sectional designs do not permit drawing conclusions regarding the causal direction. Practical implications: Organizations should transform work structures and human resources policies and provide career models that allow women flexibility and more control over their work. Research results show that values-driven predisposition may lead to low levels of perceived career success. This indirectly suggests that individuals experience intrinsic career success when their values are consistent with organizational values, and therefore they should seek work opportunities in organizations whose aim, scope, and philosophy is consistent with their ideals. Originality/value: This is the first paper to shed light on gender's impact upon the relationship between protean and boundaryless career attitudes and subjective career success, in a context in which there have been calls in literature for more career research taking into account gender differences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Career development; Gender; Self development; Spain",,"Enache, M.; Departament d'Organització d'Empreses, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Terrassa, Spain; email: mihaela.enache@upc.edu",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955938431

However, a more careful analysis of statistics finds some niches which are unfavourable to girls, since they are perceived by means of prejudice and stereotypes. This is the case of a state educational system in Brazil, where we detected a clear underrepresentation of girls in a program for gifted pupils. The research project aimed to analyze the criteria used for identifying and recommending pupils to enroll in such a program. Based on specifically processed statistics, the researchers selected the geographical area where underrepresentation reached its highest level. Then they conducted semi-structured interviews with schoolteachers as well as with teachers and psychologists of the Program. After that, each participant filled out a checklist of ""typical"" features and/or behaviours found in gifted girls and boys. Results revealed that schoolteachers underestimated girls' abilities and skills in the process of selection and recommendation for the program. According to interviews, their own negative image of woman partially affects this bias against female pupils. Nevertheless, the Program's teachers and psychologists had a much better understanding on gender inequalities and giftedness, compatible with specialized literature. Therefore, the underrepresentation of girls was a result of a largely biased, subjective selection process and recommendation at schools. As a consequence, teachers need adequate preparation if the educational system maintains the program. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Gender; Gifted students; Special education; Stereotype",,"dos Reis, A.P.P.Z.; Universidade Católica de BrasíliaBrazil",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

It is appropriate that men with access to power speak out advocating change for sustainability and yet, if this is all that happens, we risk replicating business as usual. To extend the analysis and seek more women's voices and more images associating gender, leadership and sustainability, the article reviews five novels by women authors addressing environmental issues. This exploration changes the landscape of sense-making, directing attention first to broader society rather than to organizations as the base for constructing notions of sustainability. Taking this approach, themes of social justice, equality, everyday practice, ways of knowing, embodiment and the crafts of fitting in (to nature and society) move to the foreground.

While the number of women on these boards has risen over the past decade, the overwhelming sense of these organizations is one of homogeneity. The individuals on these ministerially appointed boards are awarded institutional privilege. Their roles provide them with status and benefits and their membership positions them as leaders within the (masculine) hegemony. This space is not, however, uniformly masculinized. With the limited resources at their disposal and little public recognition of their roles, the boards have limited agency. These poorly resourced boards are populated by women and men board members, while vested with important titles, are relatively powerless and are expected to undertake duties and display behaviour that is more consistent with a feminized role. The doing of gender can also be seen in the primacy of the economic over the social in regional development, where the economic is strongly associated with creating employment, especially in industries where men have traditionally dominated, rather than in the more feminized domains of services. This doing of gender points to the persistence of conservative gender patterns reinforcing a masculinized model of business. The contradiction here is that while they subscribe to this masculinized model, they are unable to deliver on outcomes because they do not have direct control over resources. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boards; Gender; Governance; Leadership","employment; gender issue; gender relations; gender role; governance approach; hegemony; homogeneity; leadership; regional development; social construction; womens status; Australia","Sheridan, A.; School of Business, Economics and Public Policy, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; email: asherida@une.edu.au",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954990007

Still, at some point, she goes beyond merely repeating the dominant discourse in constructing her own political subjectivity. In tracking her life story, the micro dynamics of her agency are explored through text and discourse analysis in which intertextuality and intersectionality of gender are instrumental.

In the context of a wider study of motherhood in the UK, their experience of combining work with new motherhood was distinctive. Women who professionally care for young children present a counter-narrative to the view that teaching and motherhood can be blended. Negotiating the boundaries between work and motherhood produced a troubling reflexivity in which difficult feelings emerged and collided. Working in urban education involves emotionally intense forms of attachment that are disrupted by pregnancy. Becoming a mother prompts a renegotiation of professional and personal boundaries, leading women to pursue mothering as a separate enterprise, marked by individual solutions to care and career.

Whilst these women's understandings of the 'Black middle classes' are informed by their gendered and racialised experiences, there is also evidence of a denial of (class) privilege. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Class; Gender; Identities; Race",,"Maylor, U.; Institute for Policy Studies in Education, London Metropolitan University, London, United Kingdom; email: uvanney.maylor@beds.ac.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959226223

This assumption is teamed with evidence that males are actually a variant on the female sex with brains masculinized in ways that help them respond to female mating preferences. To orchestrate male responses to female biases in mates, the theory asserts that androgens (male sex hormones) have two main effects on human brain functioning. One is a diminished sensitivity to most environmental stimuli.

The perspectives tend to differ on the issue of the origins of (some) beauty standards. Evolutionary scientists have proposed that beauty is a reliable cue for women's health and fertility. However, as the factors regulating health and reproductive capabilities cannot be directly observed, sexual selection has fashioned psychological adaptations to attend to bodily features that are correlated with health and fertility. It is proposed that people resonate to such bodily features and find them attractive. One such bodily feature in women is gynoid body distribution (i. e., female-normative body shape in which fat distribution is concentrated around hips and thighs). Gynoid body fat distribution is measured by the ratio of waist and hips circumferences (WHR). In this paper we summarize empirical evidence showing that WHR is an independent predictor for risks for major diseases, optimal hormonal profile, and reproductive capabilities. Next, we present findings from studies that demonstrate systematic variations in the size of WHR produce systematic changes in judgment of female attractiveness within diverse societies throughout the world. Such widespread appeal of low WHR suggests that people have evolved mental mechanisms to judge body features indicative of good health as attractive, meaning that some standards of beauty are not arbitrary or constructed. We conclude that a better understanding and appreciation of the beauty-health linkage can be empowering to women. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body weight; Evolutionary psychology; Female beauty; Media; Waist-to-hip ratio",,"Singh, D.; Department of Psychology, University of Texas, 1 University Station A8000, Austin, TX 78712, United States; email: dorian.singh@sant.ox.ac.uk",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79956309516

As illustrated in the portrayal of a case in which immigrant parents murdered their teenaged daughter, Tina Isa, the discourse of tradition versus modernity renders certain important facts illegible, underemphasizing or ignoring the structures of power within which violence against women occurs. This simple story positions culture and feminism as opponents in a zero-sum game and presumes that women will be emancipated when they have overcome or abandoned their cultures. But immigrant women possess a complex subjectivity that is not reducible to cultural victimization. This is illustrated in this article through the work of Asian American domestic violence advocacy groups, navigating antiracist and antisexist practice, and by the expert testimony given in a case of attempted parent-child suicide by a Sikh immigrant. Rather than position the immigrant as the disorderly and strange bearer of archaic traditions, this article argues for greater recognition of the role of racism, state policies, and material concerns in shaping immigrants' experiences of culture. © 2011 by Brown University and differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies.",,,"Volpp, L.; University of California, Berkeley School of LawUnited States",,,10407391,,,,"English","Differences",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955151844

As in other capitalist regimes, the question of the rights of undocumented migrants in Turkey presents a major paradox. On the one hand, the undocumented migrants' lack of right to residence, work, and social security intensifies their vulnerability in the flexible, predominantly informal labor market. On the other hand, rights claims risk naturalizing deeper structural inequalities as they simultaneously seek to ameliorate them. The predicament of Bulgarian Turkish migrants brings its own twist to the thorny question of rights for undocumented migrants. Historically the most privileged among migrants in Turkey because of their ""Turkish origins,"" the recent Turkish migrants from Bulgaria continue to deploy the language of ethnic privilege in pursuing their claims. While such particularistic claims may result in individual gains for some migrants, they tend to preclude collective forms of migrant organizing and foreclose the articulation of more radical political and economic demands. After demonstrating the double binds of the specific rights claims available to Bulgarian Turkish migrants in Turkey, the article concludes by pondering the possibilities for an alternative, incipient discourse of rights that takes labor rather than ethnicity as the basis of entitlement. © 2011 by Brown University and differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies.",,,"Parla, A.; Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey",,,10407391,,,,"English","Differences",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955135272

Marked as a culturally specific form of violence and given a special and stigmatizing association with Muslims, especially after the 1990s, the honor crime does significant political work in the world today. Through an examination of popular literature, human rights reports, and anthropological and sociological studies, this article uncovers the forces that produce and maintain this category of spectacular cultural violence; the elements of popular fantasy that animate it; the forms of modern state and transnational power the category occludes; and the ahistorical and divisive civilizational thinking it encourages. Drawing both on ethnography from one Egyptian Bedouin community in which honor is a key moral value and on the critical analysis of diverse representations of the honor crime in Germany, Sweden, Palestine, Turkey, Jordan, and elsewhere, the author explores how the seductive power of the honor crime, mixing sexual titillation and moral horror, and its truly polymorphous interpretive capacity have enabled it to emerge as a robust category implicated in projects that include the policing and exclusions of immigrants; nation-states' disciplinary penetration of rural and urban subaltern communities; dominance by specific national, ethnic, or class groups; manipulation of liberal values in the service of assertions of Western superiority; and justifications of international intervention and transnational governance in the name of women's rights, including by feminists. © 2011 by Brown University and differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies.",,,"Abu-Lughod, L.; Department of Anthropology, Institute for Research on Women and Gender, Columbia UniversityUnited States",,,10407391,,,,"English","Differences",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955131663

This article approaches these questions from an unusual angle, focusing on the passing of competition and antitrust laws and the establishment of a Competition Authority in Turkey alongside the story of a fictional institute called The Clock Setting Institute in Ahmet Hamdi Tanpnar's novel of the same name. Arguing that Tanpnar's story, and the modernization parody it constructs, offers significant insights that help bring to light otherwise invisible dimensions of neoliberal state reforms, the author discusses how neoliberalism and its technologies are translated into a language of modernization and appropriated as tools in the service of civilizing the nation, in Turkey and in the global south. This translation-and transformation-not only shows how an otherwise alien legal and economic technology takes root by being translated into the local lingua of statehood in Turkey but also highlights a remarkable continuity between the practices of the modernizing state and the neoliberal state. According to this article, the real work of neoliberal technologies, competition law, and economics consists of importing and mobilizing the ""scientific"" (economic) tools of representing the economic reality ""out there.""

Although Turkish feminists have long worked to raise awareness of the gendered inequality and violence involved, their efforts until recently were met with stark silence. The increased attention given to honor crimes involves little interest in the patriarchal excesses that affect women across class and ethnic groups in Turkey, tending to focus attention, rather, on an essentialized ""Kurdish"" or ""Eastern"" culture as the main dynamic behind honor crimes. Blame for the practice is attributed to the intractable customs of backward peoples, customs that are disconnected from discussions of capitalism, state bureaucracy, armed conflict, or familial practice prevalent in Turkey's public sphere. Drawing on extensive archival research and fieldwork, the author argues that the recent focus on the ""custom"" is symptomatic of a shift from a developmentalist/assimilationist to a cultural/racial imaginary. By looking at the intricate web of practices, meanings, institutions, and policies that make up the Turkish public sphere, this article sheds light on how the custom came to be recognized in Turkey and how familial modes of conduct influence current modes of governing minorities. © 2011 by Brown University and differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies.",,,"Koǧacioǧlu, D.; Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Sabanci UniversityTurkey",,,10407391,,,,"English","Differences",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955164135

This is one of the first empirical research studies to address whether couples who have experienced IPV prior to enrollment have an elevated risk of violence during a couple education program. Data are from the Family Formation Project, a federally funded Healthy Marriage Initiative working with urban, low-income, unmarried parent couples (N = 90), of whom 44% reported IPV prior to enrollment. We present our IPV screening protocol and illustrate the types of violence found at enrollment. Of note is that no cases of ""intimate terrorism""-the most serious controlling violence-were found in this sample. Findings for increased risk for IPV showed no statistically significant elevated risk during the program among those with prior IPV experience. However, sample size and other methodological limitations suggest that the ""no elevated risk"" finding be interpreted with caution.

This paper examines the situation of Ecuadorian women selling cosmetics through a multilevel direct sales organization in which earnings are dependent on the amount of product sold and the number of sellers recruited. This relatively new type of gendered, paid employment promises to help women achieve balance between paid work and family responsibilities. Using ethnographic methods to explore direct-selling mothers' identities, strategies, and struggles, this study finds that such a balance remains elusive for these women sellers, despite the purported flexibility of direct sales work. It discusses the finding that women think about their paid work and family roles as connected and examines the myth prevalent among direct sellers that successfully balancing paid work and family comes from ""organizing yourself."" © 2011 IAFFE.","Family responsibilities; Informal economy; Women and work",,"de Casanova, E.

Using advanced panel data methods on European Community Household Panel (ECHP) data for 1994-2001, this study finds women's employment to be negatively associated with informal caregiving to the elderly across the European Union. For the countries included in the study, the effects of informal caregiving seem to be more negative in Southern Europe, less negative in Nordic countries, and in between these extremes in Central Europe. This study explains that since eldercare is a choice in countries with more formal care and less pronounced gendered care norms, the weaker impact of eldercare on women's employment in these countries has to do with the lesser degree of coercion in the caring decision. © 2011 IAFFE.","European welfare states; Female labor supply; Informal care",,"Kotsadam, A.; Department of Economics, University of Gothenburg, Box 640, Gothenburg SE-405 30, Sweden; email: andreas.kotsadam@nova.no",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

The purpose of this study is to contribute to improving the HSA as an analytical tool. Two approaches are proposed, drawing on existing data from Catalonia, Spain. The first approach involves incorporating the analysis of time as a key component of HSAs, making it possible to explore aspects of unpaid housework without the influence of monetary valuation. The second develops a new methodology that captures information on both housework and market work, overcoming some of the limitations of current databases used in the calculation of HSAs and allowing an analysis of the various interrelationships that exist between the two types of work. © 2011 IAFFE.","Household production; Satellite accounts; Time use",,"Carrasco, C.; Universitat de Barcelona Facultat d'Economia i Empresa, Av.

Such differences are relevant, as network theory suggests that structural characteristics - as well as the contents of networks - strongly influence the type and amount of benefits generated. Through the application of dyadic regression techniques, this study examines the determinants of the size and socioeconomic heterogeneity of individual networks. Research findings suggest gender segregation of networks and considerable differences in the structure and content of men's and women's networks. These differences relate to the gendered division of labor and to women's time poverty in particular. Our results are relevant in a context where policy makers increasingly consider social networks an important policy tool. We caution against a gender-blind alignment on existing social networks and argue for detailed mapping and unpacking of social networks through a gender lens. © 2011 IAFFE.","Dyadic regression; Gender sorting; Gendered labor division; Rural nicaragua; Social network analysis",,"D'Exelle, B.; School of International Development, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7JT, United Kingdom; email: B.DExelle@uea.ac.uk",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

This study uses individual-level data for several OECD countries to examine how men's participation in home production can explain the positive relationship between fertility and women's labor force participation at the cross-country level. It finds that women living in countries where men participate more in home production are better able to combine having children with market work, leading to greater participation in the labor force at relatively high fertility levels. Within each country however, women with higher relative wages continue to have lower fertility and to participate more in the labor force than lower-paid women due to the higher opportunity cost of remaining at home. This finding on men's home production can thus explain the positive cross-country correlation between female labor force participation and fertility. © 2011 IAFFE.","Childcare; Fertility; Housework; Social externality; Time use; Women's labor force participation",,"de Laat, J.; Department of Economics, Université du Québec a Montréal 315, rue Ste-Catherine Est, Montréal, QC, H2X 3X2, Canada; email: jdelaat@worldbank.org",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

This research was grounded on the feminist paradigm, and the case study approach was used for data collection and analysis. The results indicate that the lesbian survivor encountered numerous obstacles to admitting the rape and seeking help. A number of these perceived challenges were associated with the rural sociocultural context (e.g., conservative culture, religious fundamentalism, low levels of anonymity, small gay/lesbian communities, and geographical isolation), myths of lesbian utopia, a heterosexist legal system, and a lack of lesbianfriendly helping resources. Despite being confronted with numerous challenges, the survivor demonstrated her resilience through the use of a variety of strategies to cope with the rape aftermath and detrimental social reactions. Positive social support from her gay and lesbian friends also facilitated her recovery.

How they negotiate interactions with peers, family and others is important for young people's understanding of who they are and how they fit into their communities. Although research within the new social studies of childhood has focused to some extent on children's family and peer relationships, little attention has been given to the particular dynamics inherent in the relationships of working children. This article therefore focuses on the lives of young commercial sex workers in Ethiopia, and explores how the spatial and temporal performances of multiple fractured identities are used in the negotiation of relationships that take place within and beyond the spaces of sex work. Qualitative research was carried out with 30 teenage 'bar girls', aged 14-19, who are engaged in sex work in Nazareth, to explore the processes that influence and shape their lives. Drawing on a conceptualisation of performativity that recognises the spatiality of performative identities, the article illustrates how young sex workers manage multiple identities across the spaces of sex work and how their identities change through relationships at work, in their communities and with their families. The article demonstrates that the nuanced micro-power negotiations taking place result in feminine identities that are encased within wider structures of rural poverty. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Ethiopia; Identities; Performativity; Sex work; Young people","feminism; identity construction; poverty; prostitution; young population; Israel; Nazareth; Northern District","van Blerk, L.; Department of Geography, University of Dundee, Nethergate, Dundee, DD1 4HN, United Kingdom; email: l.c.vanblerk@dundee.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952458597

This commercial promotes the 'One Pack = One Vaccine' initiative between Pampers and UNICEF, a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign that supplies a tetanus vaccine to a woman in the South with each purchase of Pampers in North America. This article critically examines the way that CRM (and the One Pack initiative in particular) links individual consumption choices to development while simultaneously delinking consumption from environmental degradation, health risks and global inequalities. Taking this argument further, it uses a feminist perspective to examine the ways in which the narratives of 'first world women' and 'third world women' are depicted and used in the One Pack initiative, to make certain North-South power dynamics invisible while highlighting others. This is accomplished through a discourse of an imagined community of global motherhood. Drawing on insights gained from key informant interviews and discourse analysis, it is argued that the One Pack initiative discourses constrain North-South connections to those based on capitalist and colonial power relations. This limits the potential of CRM to promote more engaged, responsible and just terms of connection between the North and South. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Cause-related marketing; Development; Ethical consumption; North-South; Third world women","capitalism; commodity; ethics; feminism; marketing; North-South relations; power relations","Hawkins, R.; Geography, Clark University, 950 Main St, Worcester, MA 01610, United States; email: rohawkins@clarku.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952476137

In Cuba, many Afro-Cuban cultural practices, such as rumba, have been subject to social and spatial exclusion. In this context, sites such as the home, the street and the family emerge as highly significant for the learning and performance of Afro-Cuban music and dance. Learning primarily from family members and through spaces such as the home, street and neighborhood contributes to ambiguous understandings of rhythmic responsiveness as both instinctive and learned, inside and outside the body, cultural and natural. Many rumba performers also deploy flexible understandings of rhythmic natures to assert the social and material significance of racial differentiation in a context where the implications of 'race' are often denied. Even at their most fixed, however, these understandings of bodily and rhythmic natures remain contingent on important people and places for their development. The practice of learning rhythmic responsiveness highlights that, although bodily trajectories are not predetermined, bodies develop differently through different places, practices and relations to others. Importantly, this also suggests that bodily materiality and its social significances are not endlessly pliable. By examining places and specific practices for learning to respond 'naturally' to rumba rhythms, the article argues that the body's variable openness and resistance to augmentation and development lends power to highly unnatural gender and racial categories. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Cuba; Dance; Gender; Race; The body","cultural identity; gender; learning; music; race; social exclusion; Cuba","Hensley, S.; Jefferson Community and Technical College, Division of Math and Natural Sciences, Department of Geography and Geology, 109 East Broadway, Louisville, KY 40202, United States; email: shensley0060@kctcs.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952479751

The stories are contextualized within the results of a wider research project on assisted migration involving 56 interviews and demonstrate the diverse practices and experiences of women's assisted migration. By 'assisted' is meant the assistance certain migrants need in order to be able to cross borders, given the lack of legal channels available to them - a process usually talked about as smuggling or trafficking. The article argues that the policy discourse surrounding these assisted types of migration is highly gendered, reproduces stereotypes and completely ignores the wider context in which these movements take place. The fact that for some women from certain parts of the world there are no other options than to travel in this particular way, and that the risks involved in migration can be relatively low compared to the risks faced at 'home', is rarely acknowledged in accounts of human smuggling or trafficking. Moreover, framing assisted female migrants as victims can lead to the generalization that all migrant women are at risk and need to be protected. This, in turn, may lead to protective policy measures that often restrict women's choices even further. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Agency; Gender; Human smuggling; Human trafficking; Irregular migration","gender; illegal immigrant; migration; trafficking; womens status; Netherlands","van Liempt, I.; Urban and Regional Research Centre Utrecht, Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 2, P.O.

Although the hammam is usually considered a Muslim space, its Roman roots connect its customers to other histories. In this respect, a comparative social and historical analysis of women's quarters of the hammam queries the so-called Islamic city as a standard and unchanging space distinct from its European counterparts. In this article, a hammam in Ankara, Şengul Hamami{dotless}, is presented as a changing space where women negotiate their status, social positions and safety in an urban environment. Women's usage of this space as such is achieved after they meet several challenges on their way to the hammam. These challenges involve discourses of safety and danger, purity and filth, as well as dress and undress, which all seem dichotomous but at the same time converge on different levels. As a result, these challenges contribute to the daily usage of the city by women as well as to how they negotiate the historical hammam. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Discourses of danger; Negotiations; Public bath; Turkey; Women's quarters","Islamism; public space; social status; womens status; Turkey","Aksit, E.

Correlation results show endorsing traditional masculine norms was positively associated with feelings of competency, confidence, self-reliance, and feeling self-assured. Feelings of inadequacy also decreased when endorsement of masculine role norms increased. Adhering to achievement and status norms was associated with higher positive interpersonal relationships in high school and less social stress. Additionally, restricting emotions was associated with less satisfaction with friendships and social relationships for all participants.

Results indicated that the male wearing nontraditional attire was expected to earn a lower starting salary and experience more verbal harassment compared to the traditionally attired male independent of occupation type. The results also showed that the nontraditionally attired male was perceived to have higher ability in stereotypically female occupations than the traditionally attired model.

Voters transfer their stereotypes of women and men to candidates seeking office. In this article, we look at vote choice as it relates to sex differences and gender-related issues in several different contexts. First, we replicate previous experiments in which sex is the sole cue in low information contexts. Second, we vary the context of the contest by adding issue cues, thus creating a higher information context. Finally, we manipulate the issues themselves to determine the effects of assigning a male candidate an issue that is considered more important to women than to men. Overall, the results of our study suggest that voters' attributions of gender stereotypes to candidates based on their sex is complex.

I propose several key ways to distinguish a feminine logic of subject formation from a masculine logic of subjectivity. I suggest that femininity is a multiplicitous, self-proliferating strategy that forecloses truth as a means for achieving selfhood. Alternatively, I postulate that masculinity tends to masquerade as an (oftentimes failed) achievement that is singular and self-consolidating and that generates truth as a means for realising selfhood. In order to contextualise these distinctions between masculinity and femininity, I look to the recent influx of American women into masculine-marked domains such as the workforce, politics and sports without a corresponding entrance of men into feminine-marked domains. Known as the stalled gender revolution, these shifts, I argue, have created the context for the gendered divergences in subjectivity I suggest here. Focusing on examples of women in sports to illustrate these distinctions, I provide a detailed characterisation of femininity as a logic of subject formation. As such, I argue that this approach to gender may provide relevant insights to understanding gender practice, agency and resistance, particularly with respect to Butler's formulation of gender performativity and subversion. I conclude by providing some preliminary thoughts on how to re-envision agency and subversion in light of the proposed framework. © The Author(s) 2011.","agency; femininity; gender; resistance; sport; subjectivity",,"Carlson, J.; Department of Sociology, University of California at Berkeley, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-1980, United States; email: jdawncarlson@berkeley.edu",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

I posit that a more fruitful way of approaching this disputed category is to treat it as an abstraction. Drawing on the philosophical framework of critical realism I elucidate the nature of the vital and inevitable process of abstraction, as a means of finding a way out of the theoretical and methodological impasse that the 'ban' on the category 'women' has caused.

The camp was said to be based on feminist principles and sometimes these were even articulated as eco/feminist principles. The slippage between these terms provides a focus for my discussion. Specifically the article explores the apparent paradox of the sheer vitality of this eco/feminist activism, and in particular its insistence on international connections, in contrast to the widely circulating accounts of the end of feminism, and especially the end of global sisterhood, which emerged in the early 1990s. Thus this article is also necessarily about how recent histories of eco/feminism, including tensions between theory and activism, are narrated. I take as a departure point references to the work of Vandana Shiva and the Chipko movement which circulated in accounts of the camp, and explore ways in which eco/feminists might read such utterances as more than evidence of a naive and problematic universalism. I situate eco/feminism's internationalism genealogically in feminism and eco/feminism and read this as a counter-narrative to the ending of global sisterhood. Through paying attention to various movements, back and forth, between Clayoquot and Chipko, Canada and India, and drawing on Anna Tsing's notion of 'friction', I offer an account of what has been at stake in disavowals of the possibility of reading Chipko as eco/feminist, and suggest the importance of a more generous reading of eco/feminists' attention to the Chipko movement. © The Author(s) 2011.","activism; Chipko; Clayoquot; ecofeminism; end of feminism; environment; feminism; global sisterhood; international; peace camp; Shiva",,"Moore, N.; ESRC Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (CRESC), The University of Manchester, 178 Waterloo Place, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom; email: niamh.moore@manchester.ac.uk",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Based on participant observation research with a group of Mexican immigrant gardeners in Los Angeles, this article examines the construction of masculinity in a workplace occupied by Mexican immigrant men. These jardineros construct, affirm, challenge, and negotiate their masculinity through their routine work activities and through their daily on-the-job interactions with their fellow workers. Moving beyond a sort of reiteration of a flat, cultural concept of machismo, jardinero masculinity stresses a more nuanced structural understanding of Mexican immigrant men's masculinity and how it is intertwined with their performance of masculinized ""dirty work"" in private households. It is a distinctly working-class form of masculinity, which results from the interplay between very specific, localized cultural constructions, and deployment in the context of racialized nativism and citizenship hierarchy in the United States. © 2011 The Author(s).","gender and work; landscape gardening; Latino masculinity; Mexican migration; working-class masculinity",,"Ramirez, H.; University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: hernanra@usc.edu",,,1097184X,,,,"English","Men Masculin.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79954478515

Now, after 10 years, the author has interviewed some of these informants again. What do their experiences and thoughts reveal about the change in Finnish sexual culture during the past 10 years? The visibility and equality of sexual minorities has improved considerably since 1999. The law for registered partnership for same-sex couples passed in 2001, it became possible to adopt the child of a same-sex partner in 2009, and there have been various national projects on sexual equality at work and in education. Furthermore, the media often explores sexual minority issues-one could almost say that bisexuality has become a product to be consumed by different audiences.

It is a reflection on the author's experience as a keynote speaker at BiReCon, and as a participant in BiReCon and BiCon.1 The article is organized into three sections. The Preamble muses about how bisexuality manifests today, the current status of the bisexual movement, and how bisexuals (bis) are positioned within lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) communities, their institutions and in mainstream society. In this first section the author reflects upon her experience at the events. Addressing the Audience is a rendition of her actual keynote address. This second section focuses on why it's key at this time to see bisexuality as a portal to a world that is more eco-friendly and erotophile. By way of Annie Sprinkle's evolving work, the section establishes continuity between bisexuality and ecosexuality. The author also uses her own experience of bisexual erasure at the French libertine resort of Cap d'Agde to encourage more research and education about bisexuality and the multiple contexts where it manifests. The address also invites readers to imagine the world behind this portal, where a paradigm shift has already occurred. Love is considered an art, Gaia is recognized as the 'gay' planet, the homo/hetero divide has disappeared, and the energy of Eros circulates beyond socially constructed binaries.

Companies and other workplaces establish Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) policies offering workplace protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity; 2.

The majority had disclosed their sexual orientation to family or friends (98%), and 97% had someone in their lives who was accepting of their orientation. Racial/ethnic minority and female participants in general reported lower levels of disclosure and acceptance. Most participants reported some form of sexual orientation-related victimization (94%). Victimization was associated with psychological distress, but a compensatory model indicated that in the context of this victimization both peer and family support had significant promotive effects. A test of a protective model found social support did not ameliorate negative effects of victimization. The positive effects of family support decreased with age. Peer and family support were particularly important, but they did not significantly dampen the negative effects of victimization.

Research shows that substance use risk factors are higher for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youths (Eisenberg & Wechsler, 2003), and LGBT youths report higher use of substances than their heterosexual counterparts (Lampinen, McGhee, & Martin, 2006; Marshal et al., 2008; Russell, Truong, & Driscoll, 2002). However, when compared to LGBT adults, knowledge of youth substance use is limited. Unfortunately, few interventions are tailored to LGBT youths. It is necessary to investigate the factors associated with substance use that are unique to this population in order to tailor interventions to their needs. A preliminary study was conducted which adapted an evidence-based prevention program with guidance from LGBT youths at a drop-in center.

Although some medical men thought that the flow was pathological, others believed it brought significant health benefits. However, as the ability to control one's body and mind became central to eighteenth-century definitions of manhood, leaky male bodies became increasingly problematic. The understanding of male bodily flows was complicated by age and class. As such, it is important to examine 'male menstruation' within the broader context of masculinity and other flows. Looking at medical literature alongside experiences of sufferers, this article considers the extent to which male bleeding (particularly haemorrhoids) was considered desirable in the eighteenth century.

Founded by composer and philanthropist Gustave Charpentier in 1900, the Oeuvre de Mimi Pinson taught its worker-students elementary music, song and dance, and gradually expanded to include a charitable organisation and social network. A closer examination of the OMP reveals that its members were also used to reconcile early twentieth-century French anxieties about working-class militancy and even war by way of a potent cultural association of female sexuality, aesthetic refinement and labour. In the years before the First World War, the Mimi Pinsons were defined by journalists, government officials and the OMP's own organisers according to a formulaic type which at once modernised and constrained the role of the female Parisian worker. Associated almost exclusively with the luxury-garment trades - seamstresses, flowermakers, milliners and department-store clerks - the new Mimi Pinsons were embraced by the public as naturally chic yet diligent guardians of French art and craft. These female worker-students allowed an easy merging of the body of the female worker with particularly French notions of the patriotic responsibility of feminine taste. When the First World War came, many of the Mimi Pinsons joined the war effort as workers and nurses, yet they were embraced by the public primarily for their service as tasteful creators of patriotic decorative objects, and as an ideal symbolic figure for managing anxieties about the social dissolution that came with the war. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"class; cultural history; gender issue; historical geography; nineteenth century; sexuality; war; France; Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus; Parisia","Tilburg, P.; Davidson College, North Carolina, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953012756

By analysing these documents, we argue that the 'virginity testing' controversy demonstrates the intersectionality of discrimination faced by migrant women from the Indian subcontinent attempting to enter Britain in the 1970s. Previous discussions of the practice have focused on either the dimension of 'race' or gender as the determining factor behind this invasive procedure, but this article shows that both dimensions are of equal importance in explaining why immigration officers undertook 'testing' for virginity during border control investigations. The emphasis within the immigration control system on preventing 'bogus' migration informed how immigration officers processed potential migrants and this framework of suspicion allowed the practice of 'virginity testing' to occur. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"gender issue; immigration; migrants experience; racism; social history; twentieth century; womens status; United Kingdom","Smith, E.; Flinders University Law SchoolAustralia",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953015545

Like their Protestant contemporaries, Latter-day Saints spent much time attempting to find a solution. At the same time, the LDS church was experiencing its own unique set of upheavals. In 1890, one of the central tenets of Mormonism - polygamy - had to be replaced with sexual practices that aligned the LDS with wider American society. It was during this transitional period that members and authorities of the LDS church sought to gain respectability in American culture by emphasising the morality and value systems they shared with their middle-class Protestant contemporaries. As Mormons restructured marriage around the practice of monogamy, they placed the burden of the refashioned religious identity almost exclusively upon men and their bodies. The new Mormon man ushered the LDS church into the American mainstream while maintaining an acceptable difference from that mainstream culture. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"church role; cultural identity; gender issue; monogamy; nineteenth century; polygamy","Hoyt, A.; University of the Pacific, California, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953007184

A militarised rhetoric permeated the language of gay rights groups in the 1920s, providing a vision of a spiritually and politically emancipated hypermasculine gay man who fought to legitimise 'friendship' and secure civil rights.

They sought to pass the equivalent of the 1923 Equal Rights Amendment by treaty at international conferences in Europe and the Americas. The pre-eminence of the United States in the Americas granted them diplomatic access through the Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW) that, paradoxically, strengthened the NWP's position when the US administration opposed its proposed reforms. When the US signed the Nationality Rights Treaty in Montevideo, Uruguay in 1934, the NWP won a significant nationality reform, namely the right of US women to transmit citizenship to children born abroad. In exchange for its support, the Roosevelt administration required them to shelve their proposed Equal Rights Treaty.

According to an anecdote in Valerius Maximus's Memorable Doings and Sayings (c.30 CE), Pero saves her father, condemned to death by starvation, by breastfeeding him in prison. In Les Incas, it is Bartolomé de las Casas who is being cured from a fatal illness through the milk of an Amerindian princess. Jean-Michel Moreau the Younger illustrated this lactation scene in the first edition of Marmontel's novel; his engraving inspired Louis Hersent to render the topic in oil three decades later. My article explores the ways in which French Enlightenment writers and artists employed lactation imagery to propose a utopian reform of colonial relations - the voluntary offering of America's riches to benevolent white patriarchs - at a time when the nature of government authority, paternity, maternity, race and kinship were being redefined. In 1808, Hersent's painting of 'Las Casas Cured by Savages' appears curiously anachronistic in the context of contemporary novels and paintings that portray colonial relationships as inundated by death and bloodshed. In Chateaubriand's Atala (1801), lactation imagery is employed to signify white men's necrophilic desire, genocide and loss. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"biography; breastfeeding; colonialism; documentary source; lactation; starvation; Pero; Riches","Sperling, J.G.; Hampshire College, Massachusetts, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953066641

In the US coverage, boys' sexual wanting received more attention than girls' sexual wanting, whereas in the Dutch coverage sexual wanting was depicted equally often for boys and girls. The depiction of sexual pleasure did not vary by gender in either country, but was generally more visible in the Dutch magazines than in the US magazines.

This study addresses this gap in the literature by examining whether exposure to mass media is related to self-objectification and objectification of one's partner, which in turn is hypothesized to be related to relationship and sexual satisfaction. A sample of undergraduate students (91 women and 68 men) enrolled in a university on the west coast of the United States completed self-report measures of the following variables: self-objectification, objectification of one's romantic partner, relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and exposure to objectifying media. Men reported higher levels of partner objectification than did women; there was no gender difference in self-objectification. Self- and partner-objectification were positively correlated; this correlation was especially strong for men. In regression analyses, partner-objectification was predictive of lower levels of relationship satisfaction. Furthermore, a path model revealed that consuming objectifying media is related to lowered relationship satisfaction through the variable of partner-objectification. Finally, self- and partner-objectification were related to lower levels of sexual satisfaction among men. This study provides evidence for the negative effects of objectification in the context of romantic relationships among young adults. © 2011 The Author(s).","Mass media; Objectification; Relationship satisfaction; Romantic relationships; Sexual satisfaction",,"Zurbriggen, E.

The first set of analyses revealed that women's social gender identity, exposure to feminism, and gender-egalitarian attitudes independently contributed to feminist identification; moreover, non-stereotyping of feminists further predicted feminist self-identification. A second set of analyses tested the relative contribution of feminist identity components to women's cognitive appraisals of coping responses to sexual harassment.

To address research questions about how female student-athletes balance muscularity and femininity, we conducted a mixed-methods study to examine muscularity beliefs among female student-athletes, female college students, and male college student-athletes. We quantitatively examined Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS) scores from 221 participants attending college in the Midwestern US. Results indicated that female student-athletes reported significantly higher DMS scores than female students, but male student-athletes reported the highest DMS scores in the sample. Qualitative results indicated that female student-athletes wanted to be muscular for these reasons: functionality (45%), health (42%), external gratification (21%), and internal gratification (18%). Only 16% of female student-athletes did not want to be muscular, whereas every male student-athlete reported a desire to be muscular. The results of this study can be used to better understand the unique drive for muscularity among athletes, particularly female college student-athletes who live the paradox of negotiating societal standards of femininity with this desire to be muscular. This enhanced understanding can help create more nuanced interventions for coaches, administrators, and mental health professionals to use to help female student-athletes create space to resist constraining societal gender ideologies. Doing so can help these student-athletes actualize their athletic potential on the field as well as their interpersonal and intrapersonal potential off the field. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","College sports; Drive for muscularity scale (DMS); Female student-athletes; Femininity; Gender norm expectations",,"Steinfeldt, J.

A sample of 931 college students (421 male students/510 female students and 605 White students/326 Black students) under the age of 30 from a Southeastern public university provided information on fear of crime, fear for others, and other variables often associated with fear of crime. When splitting the sample by gender, results suggest that both male and female college students fear for others, but do so in very different ways. While male students' fear for others was associated with their personal characteristics (race, age and parental status) and whether they lived with an intimate, female students' fear for others was most influenced by constrained behaviors and personal fear of crime. Additionally, when testing race specific models, there were not enough minority men to split the sample for men. However, when separating the sample by race for women only, the model generally did not work for non-White women, while the model worked well for White women. Overall, the results suggest that younger individuals' fear of crime for others is gendered, associated with living status for men and personal fear for women and that racial differences among men and women should be examined in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","College; Doing gender; Fear of crime; Relationships",,"Rader, N.

This study included dyadic focus groups of 17 African American young women between the ages of 15-21. Participants were asked about meaning and salience of gendered racial identity. Results suggest that gendered racial identity had greater salience for the participants as compared to the separate constructs of racial or gender identity. The participants identified with negative stereotypes and images of African American women, issues of colorism and standards of beauty. They also emphasized the importance of self-determination. Furthermore, when asked directly about the meaning of race and gender in their lives participants indicated that race and gender simultaneously influenced their perceptions of themselves.

We find that men and women differ in their gender role attitudes, as men report more conservative attitudes than women. These differences manifest whether gender role attitude is measured as procuring basic rights for women, or empowering women politically. Moreover, men and women's gender role attitudes are not immutable-education, ethnicity, and urbanization and, in women's case, generational replacement-all act to mediate these differences. The profile of the Afghan man who would hold liberal gender role attitudes is an educated urbanite, non-Sunni or non-Pashtun, who believes in the compatibility of democracy and Islam, trusts outsiders, has exposure to the formal media, and would extend equal rights to all irrespective of gender, religion, or ethnicity.

Design/methodology/approach – Semi-structured interviews were conducted, in two phases, with young people in a large new town. Thematic analysis highlighted significant issues and suggested factors that might differentiate between those in employment, education and training and those not in this position. Findings – Young people's relationship with their Connexions PA emerged as a significant factor in mediating the extent to which they used the service as a “portal” to opportunities and resources. For some young people faced with complex and challenging circumstances, the relationship with their PA provided a uniquely stable and valued source of support. Research limitations/implications – Although drawn from a small and focused sample, the results suggests that the large-scale cuts to the service, currently underway, could have a significant impact on young people in difficult circumstances. Practical implications – The identity of the Connexions service creates issues of access for potential service users. Originality/value – The research illustrates the positive impact that PAs can have in the complex and challenging situations which some young people encounter. It highlights the nature of the relationship developed with PA as a key issue in facilitating positive changes in the lives of young people.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate critically these explanations in relation to women entrepreneurs in the informal sector in India. Design/methodology/approach – To evaluate the contrasting explanations of structuralist and new liberal approaches, questionnaire surveys were conducted in two phases, namely 2007 and 2010, over a period of several months. The sample design was stratified random and the sample was taken from a range of cities in different parts of India. Findings – The survey of 457 women entrepreneurs of the informal sector shows that although the structuralist representation is largely appropriate for women working as waged informal employees, it is not as valid for women informal entrepreneurs working on a self-employed basis. The results challenge the traditional understanding of the informal sector, and self-employed women in particular, and are discussed in the light of the institutional rational choice framework. Research limitations/implications – The analysis highlights how the decision of entrepreneurship does not stand in isolation from other decisions and choices, is in line with normative considerations, and is a collective rational choice for women entrepreneurs in the informal sector. This analysis is a first of its kind and calls for additional surveys to be undertaken of female (and male) informal entrepreneurs in other countries to establish this concept. Originality/value – The analysis critically evaluates established explanations in relation to women entrepreneurs in the informal sector through an empirical survey and establishes new explanations on women entrepreneurship. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Contingent workers; Entrepreneurs; India; Self employed workers; Women",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

While entrepreneurship research identifies access to human and financial capital as being important, fewer studies explore the role of sociocognitive factors such as self-efficacy or confidence in one's abilities to perform a particular task. This paper aims to examine gender-related attitudes toward financial management drawing from existing studies education, cognitive psychology, and entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach – The empirical study creates a measure of financial self-efficacy (FSE) and highlights the importance of age and racial differences among experienced, nascent and aspiring women entrepreneurs. Firm and individual-level data were obtained from a web survey and subsequent factor analysis and analysis of variance statistical methods utilized. Findings – Empirical findings only partially attest to the lack of confidence combined with anxiety about dealing with financial management. Age and racial differences are significantly related to FSE. Research limitations/implications – Sample size is relatively small and geographically concentrated. Practical implications – The paper suggests the need for more research regarding women entrepreneurs and their confidence with regard to financial management. It also suggests the need for possible interventions for women entrepreneurs to increase FSE. Social implications – This research examines gender differences with regard to learning math/financial management subjects and the potential need for single-gender entrepreneurial training programs that focus on finance-related activities.

It seeks to replicate and extend previous work by employing a different sample working in a large Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 242 respondents, 146 males and 96 females, using anonymously completed questionnaires, a 48 percent response rate. Measures included personal demographic and work situation characteristics, stable individual difference personality factors, job behaviors, work outcomes, after-work recovery experiences, indicators of quality of life (e.g. work-family conflict and life satisfaction) and psychological well being. Findings – There were considerable differences in personal demographic and work situation characteristics, consistent with previous findings. Females were younger, less likely to be married, worked at lower organizational levels, were less likely to supervise others, worked in smaller organizations, and earned less income. Males and females were generally similar on stable individual difference personality factors and job behaviors. Females, however, were less satisfied with their careers, less work engaged, and reported higher levels of both exhaustion and psychosomatic symptoms; findings different from those observed in other countries female managers did make greater use of the four recovery experiences examined. Research limitations/implications – Consistent with previous research, considerable demographic and work situation differences were observed. But different from previous research, female and male managers in Egypt reported some similar and some different work and well-being outcomes. The observed differences indicated that women managers are somewhat disadvantaged on both work and well being. Practical implications – These results suggest that Egyptian organizations need to devote more resources to supporting the career development of managerial and professional women. In addition, Egyptian society needs to challenge the existing stereotypes of women's roles. Entrepreneurship appears to be a realistic prospect for some women managers and professionals dissatisfied with their current careers. Originality/value – This study provides insights on similarities and differences on personal demographic characteristics and outcome measures among female and male managers in Egypt. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Career development; Egypt; Gender; Glass ceilings; Managers; Women",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

Given that a majority of Indian women are housewives and grew up in conservative family backgrounds, this analysis seeks to provide an insight into the situations that aided them and the challenges they faced in their entrepreneurial business ventures far from home. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a case study analysis through a semi-structured questionnaire designed on the concept of “Life cycle of minority owned businesses” to track enterprise activity from beginning to end. Findings – The analyses show that although respondents began their stay in Japan as housewives, they shed their image with time, used their talents and diversified into a different role without sacrificing family duties, while also creating employment opportunities for both natives and immigrants. Major hindrances faced due to socio/cultural influences, lack of government initiatives and support facilities were identified. Research limitations/implications – The research analysis has been done on three case studies only as most available respondents were in the birth phase of their enterprises. More research is required on issues like capital availability, native employee and ethnic owner relationships, legal challenges and institutional support. Practical implications – The paper draws attention to problem areas where changes in governance structure and social acceptance can create a more viable environment for immigrant entrepreneurs in Japan. Originality/value – To the best of the author's knowledge, this study is the first of its kind that explores and evaluates the status of Indian female immigrant entrepreneurs in Japan. As Indian immigrants in entrepreneurial activities in Japan are increasing every year, the paper can contribute in restructuring opportunity creation and facilitate maximum advantage. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurs; Immigrants; Innovation; Japan; Risk management; Women",,"Billore, S.; Graduate School of Media and Governance, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach – First, by relying on the extant literature, the concepts of cultural values and gender gap are framed and variables are defined. Then, the relationships among variables are hypothesized and the theoretical model is constructed. Finally, empirical tests are conducted, the results are analyzed, and theoretical/practical implications are discussed. Findings – The results show that controlling for the effects of socio-economic variables, culture still has important implications for gender gap. More specifically, it is found that conservatism value dimension is associated with higher levels of gender gap, but autonomy cultural dimension may lead to gender equality. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited to three pairs of cultural values as proposed by Schwartz. Another major limitation of this study resides in the theoretical model and linear data analysis techniques used to investigate the relationship between culture and gender gap. Practical implications – The findings of this study could have important practical implications in many areas of social sciences such as political science, management and organizational studies, education, international law, and human resource management. Social implications – By considering the implications of cultural values, policy makers and business leaders may adopt effective strategies to promote gender equalities at the societal and organizational levels. Originality/value – While many studies have focused on some narrow aspects such as gender-based differences in labour, employment, remuneration, political representation, education, and leadership, in this study, the authors relied on a comprehensive conceptualization of the gender gap. Considering the reliability of data and the variety of countries/cultures included, the results seem very significant. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Cross-cultural studies; Equal opportunities; Gender; Social values",,,,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952350133

This article illustrates the value of applying a Foucaultian ""analytics of government"" to generate insights on the effects of inserting feminist knowledge into institutional contexts through the practices of gender mainstreaming and diversity management. I first reinterpret these strategies as technologies of government that meet the characteristics identified in the literature on governmentality. Second, I explore the liberal rationality of the contemporary apparatus of gender by juxtaposing it to the disciplinary rationality underlying efforts to govern women at the turn of the nineteenth century. Third, I tease out similarities and differences in the way in which diversity management and gender mainstreaming operate, emphasizing, in particular, the way in which they make difference productive and outlining how one deploys a neoliberal logic and the other a bureaucratic logic. Ultimately, I argue that governance feminism should be interpreted as the governmentalization of feminist knowledge; that is, feminist knowledge has been adapted so that it becomes available for the government of conduct. © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Prügl, E.; International Relations at Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, Geneva, Switzerland; email: elisabeth.pruegl@graduateinstitute.ch",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

First, the array of welfare services is of equal, or greater, importance than welfare transfers; second, spending varies across substantively different domains; and third, the welfare state is profoundly shaped by gender. While a comprehensive body of research has provided many claims and critiques on these points, their potential for empirical examination has not been fully realized. This article addresses these points by analyzing development according to substantively disaggregated measures of welfare spending, as well as theorizing and testing explicit gender-relevant influences alongside established indicators. Results from cross-sectional and fixed-effect models indicate that established factors are particularly relevant for transfer spending, and much less so for services. Notably, gender measures emerge as strong determinants of services spending generally, but the specific impact of gender varies according to both the substantive spending domain and the aspect of gender being measured. The findings, overall, show strong support for the broader inclusion of gender, and the utility of moving beyond programmatic generalist approaches. © The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2011.",,,"Bolzendahl, C.; Sociology at University of California, Irvine, CA 92697, United States; email: cbolzend@uci.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

Teen clinics were randomly assigned to treatment and comparison conditions. Teens attending treatment clinics were directed to view one of two very brief condom-promoting PowerPoint presentations linked to teen-friendly health websites. Teens attending comparison clinics were allowed to use the computers for whatever purposes they chose. Treatment teens returning for follow-up appointments 3-6 months later knew more of the relevant information and were more likely to have ""always"" used condoms than comparison teens who did not have directed guidance in using the computers. This study suggests that to achieve meaningful outcome-based health education using computers and the Internet in clinics serving low-income minority youth, directed learning is likely to be more efficacious than unguided exploration or general use. Indeed, directed learning using technology may help reduce some of the health disparities experienced by low-income minority youth by increasing protective behaviors.

The current study explored the potential for using social networking sites (SNS), specifically MySpace, to connect youth to sexual health services. Surveys and focus groups with youth aged 14-19 living in low-income communities in California revealed high levels of overall Internet access, frequent use of SNS, and experience in searching for health information online. However, disparities in frequency and location of Internet access by race/ethnicity, and hesitancy among some youth to join a clinic's online social network, may affect the success of this new strategy in some populations. Interviews with clinic staff highlighted the successes and challenges of using MySpace as part of their outreach efforts. Staff described balancing the benefits of web-based outreach, including its low cost, wide reach, and teen friendliness, with its challenges, including overcoming technological barriers, ensuring teens' safety from inappropriate contact, and remaining timely and relevant given the dynamic nature of the Internet.

However, this cannot account for welfare reforms emphasis upon heterosexual marriage and fatherhood promotion. The paper traces continuities and shifts in over a century of familial regulation through American welfare policy, specifying the place of marriage promotion within welfare policy. Up until 1996, families were key sites of intervention through which the American welfare state was erected, especially through single women as mothersnot wives. However, as of the 1960s, concern with African American mens ""failed"" familial commitments turned policymakers toward concern over marriage promotion for women and men. While marriage ""disincentives"" for aid recipients were lifted in the 1960s, the 1996 reforms structured a new form of nuclear family governance actively promoting marriage rooted in, but distinct from, the previous. Given the historical absence of welfare policies available to poor men, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families' (TANF) marriage promotion policies have positioned poor women as nodes connecting the state to poor men, simultaneously structuring poor women as breadwinners, mothers, and wives. Recent welfare reform has also started to target poor men directly, especially in fatherhood and marriage promotion initiatives. The article highlights how, in addition to workfare policies, marriage promotion is a neoliberal policy shifting risk to the shoulders of the poor, aiming to produce ""strong families"" for the purposes of social security. © The Author 2011.

Recent feminist research into generational change has largely avoided this tension by focusing on the shifting meanings of feminism and the discrepancy between young womens reluctance to identify as ""feminists"" and their general acceptance of feminist attitudes toward gender issues. Nevertheless, in an era when gender equity goals seem to be if not slipping backwards then lacking urgency, young women are less likely to identify with a collective feminist politics than are older women. Underpinned by the findings of a major study of the attitudes toward work, family, and retirement of three generations of Australian women, this paper develops an approach that helps explain this reluctance. Drawing on the work of Karl Mannheim, the paper suggests that the cultural currents shaping the consciousness of different generations of women impact significantly on gender identity. The implications of this cultural shift are considered in the context of feminist politics and the contemporary ""culture wars."". © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.

The theoretical and empirical basis of this argument is examined here by looking first at the conceptual foundations of the adult worker model formulation and then at the extent to which social policy reform in western Europe fits with the argument. It is suggested that the adult worker formulation is under-specified. A framework incorporating four dimensionsthe treatment of individuals vis - vis their family role and status for the purposes of social rights, the treatment of care, the treatment of the family as a social institution, and the extent to which gender inequality is problematizedis developed and then applied. The empirical analysis reveals a strong move towards individualization as social policy promotes and valorizes individual agency and self-sufficiency and shifts some childcare from the family. Yet evidence is also found of continued (albeit changed) familism. Rather than an unequivocal move to an individualized worker model then, a dual earner, gender-specialized, family arrangement is being promoted. The latter is the middle way between the old dependencies and the new ""independence. "" This makes for complexity and even ambiguity in policy, a manifestation of which is that reform within countries involves concurrent moves in several directions. © The Author 2011.

It focuses on the enunciation of gender roles and relations in the discourses that framed and justified the Act as well as on how the capacity to establish and maintain autonomous households was constructed and legitimized. Two sets of discourses emerged during the deliberations over the Act, each of which endeavored to interpret the needs, identities, and capacities for action among lone-parent families. The article shows how a specific version of the capacity to establish and maintain autonomous householdsthat of caregivers who happen to be workerswas privileged in the policy paradigm underlying the Act. The alternative visionthat of workers with caregiving responsibilitieswas marginalized and eventually disregarded in the final wording and implementation of the Act. The article concludes with an analysis of the socio-political processes that underlie the prioritization of the version, which was ultimately expressed in the implementation of the Act. It is suggested that a state-level collective identity project shaped by demographic concerns and geo-political factors and changes in the political economy combined to define the needs, identities, and capacities for action of lone-parent families in terms of a model of motherhood in which care-giving trumped paid work. © The Author 2011.

Very little research has been conducted, however, on the association between different family policy regimes and childrens well-being. This article explores how the different family policy regimes of twenty OECD countries relate to childrens well-being in the areas of child poverty, child mortality, and educational attainment and achievement. We focus specifically on three family policies: family cash and tax benefits, paid parenting leaves, and public child care support. Using panel data for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005, we test the association between these policies and child well-being while holding constant for a number of structural and policy variables. Our analysis shows that the dual-earner regimes, combining high levels of support for paid parenting leaves and public child care, are strongly associated with low levels of child poverty and child mortality. We find little long-term effect of family policies on educational achievement, but a significant positive correlation between high family policy support and higher educational attainment. We conclude that family policies have a significant impact on improving childrens well-being, and that dual-earner regimes represent the best practice for promoting childrens health and development. © The Author 2011.

This dystopia specifically frames the lesbian subject as a bodily terrain of self-estrangement, and names the film's network of alienated corporeal, subcultural, and sonic space. Feminist dystopia ultimately describes female empowerment's precarious position in a sexual and sonic landscape of non-normativity and offers a way to visualize oppositional practices that do not readily correspond to liberation. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","alienation; dystopia; feminism; lesbianism; postpunk; soundscape; ugliness",,"Howard, Y.; University of Southern CaliforniaUnited States; email: yettahoward@yahoo.com",,,0740770X,,,,"English","Women Perform.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79961064134

The study of migrant remittances has been at the heart of the fast-growing literature on migration and development. And yet, surprisingly, remittances and gender issues have rarely been brought together as a subject of inquiry. Based on recent research in south-east Albania, our paper aims to address this gap. We do this in three ways. First, we examine who sends, who receives, and who uses remittances, from a gender perspective.

Third, we analyse how gender relations and gendered social norms shape migration and remitting patterns; and how these, in turn, affect gender relations in migrant households and in origin communities.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws mainly on the literature about gender, leadership and organizational crisis to explore whether masculinity predicts crisis proneness, and the extent to which leadership attributes as well as risk-taking and decision-making style are efficient predictors of perceived crisis preparedness (CP). Utilizing pertinent literature and concepts, the paper evaluates a database of 231 female and male managers. Findings: As hypothesized, masculinity is positively associated, whereas transformational leadership is inversely associated with perceived crisis proneness. Both participative decision making and passive management predict higher degree of perceived crisis proneness and so does risk taking. Research limitations/implications: More in-depth research as well as larger and more diverse sample is required to explore more definitively why and how masculinity is positively associated with crisis proneness. Practical implications: The paper provides preliminary evidence regarding the merits of feminine leadership traits as facilitators of CP This finding does not, however, preclude the usefulness of masculine attributes in managing actual organizational crises. The findings appear particularly relevant given the current turbulent business environments and the increasing frequency and magnitude of corporate crises.

In addition, it explored whether such effects were gender specific by examining the moderating effect of gender. Design/methodology/approach: Data were obtained from a sample of 485 managers in India. Analysis was done using multiple regressions. Findings: Analyses revealed that family support, co-worker support, supervisor support, WLBPs, work-family culture and job characteristics predicted WFE while family support and job characteristics predicted FWE. Little moderating influence of gender was found. Gender moderated the relationship between WLBPs and WFE such that the relationship between the two was stronger for women as compared to men. Similarly, gender moderated the link between job characteristics and WFE such that the relationship between the two was stronger for men than women. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design of the study constrains inferring conclusions regarding causality. Practical implications: WLBPs have to be offered to women executives and organizations do have to make jobs more enriching in order to increase the level of WFE among women and men, respectively.

One hundred ninety-two male and 591 female undergraduates, almost exclusively white, in Kentucky observed two gender-typical white men (one very masculine and the other of average masculinity, both low in femininity, both gay) play a word game on videotape; prior to playing, each man labeled either himself or the other man as either gay or adopted. Male participants rated the men as less masculine and more feminine than female participants, but the label used did not differentially influence male and female participants. Both male and female participants rated each man less masculine and more feminine when labeled gay than when the other man was labeled gay, and rated the more masculine man less masculine and more feminine when labeled gay than when labeled adopted. Whether either man was labeled by himself or by the other man, or whether either man was a labeler or in the presence of a self-labeler, had no effect on participants' ratings of the men's masculinity or femininity.

After the cross-national transition to the U.S., however, he confronted unique and particular challenges in negotiating his multiple identities. As a foreigner, adopting the cultural discourse of the gay Asian-American identity as a way of life shocked and surprised him-especially because of the ways in which others communicated with him. In particular, others generally viewed his identity expression as reinforcing the stereotypical image of gay men and failing to conform with the social perception of Asian-Americans. Also, the racialized and gendered image of gay Asian-American men became a conflict in his interactions with gay and bisexual men because its image did not fully represent who he is. Being trapped by his dual-identity conflict, he faced difficulty in negotiating performative aspects of gay Asian-American male identity construction. At the same time, this contradiction became an opportunity for him to (de)construct his dual identity conflict and to finally name himself with such labeling. This analysis employs autoethnography to explore the author's cross-national transformation process of becoming a gay Asian-American man. Finally, this analysis intends to link his personal experience and the cultural and social experiences of gay Asian-American male identity. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Autoethnography; Cross-national transition; Dual-identity conflict; Gay Asian-American man; Identity negotiation",,"Eguchi, S.; Department of Communication and Culture, Howard University, 525 Bryant Street, NW, Washington, DC 20059, United States; email: S_Eguchi@howard.edu",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

Our study is important against a background that in Sub-Saharan African, HIV and AIDS is mostly spread through sexual intercourse, and that the region bears a disproportionate large percentage of the world's HIV and AIDS burden. Although Ghana has a 2009 adult (15+ years) prevalence rate of 1.6% and a prevalence rate of 1.9% for persons 15-49 years old, some regions and sentinel sites show rather high rates, making HIV and AIDS issues of high concern nationally. Respondents from the general public, key informants and special groups across all three ecological zones of Ghana were purposively selected. All the interviewees agreed that in Ghana fidelity in all sexual relationships is highly valued and expected. However, there is gender discrimination in the application of such social norms of fidelity, in favor of males. Amongst the three agents of socialization studied, religion seemed to exert the most influence. Modernity interwoven with Christianity seem to have taken a great toll on such norms of sexual socialization. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ghana; Religion; Sexual socialization; Sexuality; Society; The State",,"Owusu, A.

Shifting standards theory (Biernat In The shifting standards model: Implications of stereotype accuracy for social judgment, APA, Washington DC, 1995) suggests that individuals will judge female targets more harshly than male targets, based on culturally ingrained stereotypes regarding sexual behavior. On the contrary, intergroup bias theory (Brewer In Psychol Bull 86:307-324, 1979) predicts that individuals will judge outgroup targets, or members of the opposite sex, more harshly than ingroup targets, or members of the same sex. Participants were shown a hard copy of presumable evidence that extradyadic computer-mediated behavior had occurred, engaged in by one of two members of a couple. The two groups differed only by the sex of the target, the female ""Colleen"" or the male ""Bill"". Then participants reported their attitudes toward the target's behavior, resulting distress, and likelihood to terminate the relationship. Results showed support for the intergroup bias theory, suggesting that individuals altered their attitudes toward the behavior based on whether the target was an ingroup or outgroup member. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cyber-infidelity; Intergroup bias; Sexual double standards; Shifting standards",,"Hackathorn, J.; Saint Louis University, 221 N Grand Blvd, Shannon Hall 16, St. Louis, MO 63103, United States; email: jhackath@slu.edu",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

A cross -sectional design was used to collect data from 487 married non-pregnant women aged 18 to 49 years who resided in three southern governorates in Jordan using a structured interview guide. Results showed that 63.2% of women used some form of contraceptive method; IUD was the most frequently used method (44.2%). The percentage of women exposed to violence was 5% and 9.2% for physical and verbal abuse respectively. Findings also showed that there was a significant relationship between psychological wellbeing of women and contraceptive use. Furthermore, no relationship between women's perceived religious stance towards contraceptives and their use. Predictors of contraceptive use were: women aged 40-45 years explained 23.3% of the variance in contraceptive use; and the woman's approval of contraceptive use for birth spacing explained 21.4% of the variance in contraceptive use. The Islamic stance towards contraceptive use was not significant in these women; however further studies are needed to confirm these findings as well as the generalizability to Muslim women in other countries. The study findings have implications for health and social policies relevant to family planning services in order to enhance and increase the use of contraceptives to reduce the TFR in Jordan.

The article reads James and Rossetti's death writing as neither definitively conforming to or subverting social norms about the links between death and femininity.

Given that the contemporary prospects of retributive justice and inter-ethnic reconciliation in Bosnia-Herzegovina remain a distant prospect, the question of what can be done to reassert the ethical value of the victims of mass rape and violence continues to be of great importance. Minow's response to this question is that even 'if the rigor of prosecution and punishment are not pursued, some other form of public acknowledgement, overcoming communal denial, is the very least that can be done to restore dignity to victims (1998: 17). Pertaining to this, women s testimonies of wartime violation have resulted in the conception of critical and reflective cultural texts such as the two analysed in this paper. As if I Am Not There (Drakilić, 1999) and Esma's Secret (Žbanić, 2006) attempt to confront Bosnian society about its neglect of the women who suffered wartime rape. The texts further broach the subject of the social significance of the children who were born as a result of these rapes. The underlying focus of these texts is an attempt to propose and work towards a vision of post-conflict Bosnian society based on a future of reconciliation and the refusal to differentiate along ethnic lines.","Narrative; Post-conflict; Reconciliation",,"Todorova, T.; The University of NottinghamUnited Kingdom",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Although presenting a largely sympathetic view of the 'fallen woman', the eventual catastrophic and puzzling demise of the protagonist casts a bleak picture of the likelihood of redemption for such women in nineteenth century British society. As several feminist critics have pointed out, the narrative is frequently disrupted by the unspoken presence female sexuality suggesting Gaskell's uncertainty about the nature of her heroine's fall; was Ruth's sexual encounter borne out of naïve ignorance, exploitation, sin, or - dare we say it - curiosity and pleasure. I argue that this uncertainty and ambiguity becomes apparent through careful interrogation of scenes of crying in the novel. These scenes also reveal the layers of significance tears hold, over and above their simplistic, and perhaps misleading, relation to the penitential tears of the Magdalene. Tears are also shown as affecting the gaze, bound up as it is in power and gender relations. Gaskell reveals a glimpse of the active and potentially subversive female gaze in her observant protagonist, but soon finds ways of occupying it with jobs that require careful 'watching'. I argue that this relates closely to the author's own project of observation of social injustice. The female author is empowered by her work effectively 'nursing' social ills, but the call to empathy that becomes the overriding feature of the novel, draws attention away from some of the more challenging questions raised by the tearful gaze.","Elizabeth Gaskell; Empathy; Mary Magdalene; The fallen woman; The gaze",,"Langridge, R.; University of YorkUnited Kingdom",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Understanding Carr's engagement with tragic overliving offers grounds for re-envisioning Carr's oeuvre, various though it appears, as a cohesive whole underlain by a coherent philosophy of tragedy. She has inherited this philosophy, but she has also reconceived it by offering a sustained exploration of the ways female characters respond to the consciousness of overliving and the impact of the potential to conceive and bear children on that consciousness. This article analyzes the manifestations of the problem of overliving in six of Carr's published plays in a effort to trace the continuities between the plays commonly known as Carr's ""trilogy""-The Mai (1994), Portia Coughlan (1996), and By the Bog of Cats..

The presence of colonial wealth, though seemingly incidental in a work that focuses on charitable women, betrays an underlying anxiety about slave labor. Significantly, both the narrator and the women of Millenium Hall possess fortunes acquired in the New World. By tracing how such fortunes compromise the health of the men who earned them, this article argues that the novel offers evidence of Scott's apprehension that colonial wealth may be deeply tainted and may even become a source of moral contagion and physical deterioration whose effects can be mitigated only by a process of inheritance and transmission. After analyzing the role of the creole narrator, the article suggests that because the novel links colonial wealth to moral contagion, the women's putative moral superiority is cast in doubt. © University of Tulsa, 2011.

The research explores how Muslim young men's identities are defined by their social and cultural locations. It is argued that identity is multi-dimensional. It intersects and overlaps with several categories of difference including ethnicity, social class, gender, linguistic, cultural and religious affiliations. These exist simultaneously in daily interactions. They are fluid, interconnected, complex and not always easy to disentangle. Ethnography and grounded theory are used to capture the experiences of Muslim young men at a time when educational opportunities and career choices exist alongside disengagement with education and society. For these students the idea of success, though important, is problematic. Real success is tied not just to proven academic ability, but also to finding fulfilment through negotiating a carefully maintained balance between the private and public, secular and religious, individual and community-based expectations. Experiences linked to social class position are fore-grounded. When these intersect with race and grace, a complex picture emerges where young men from Pakistani Muslim background feel that they are both outsiders and insiders in a country where they were born and educated. This exploratory study captures a complex multi-layered world where race is not the only lens through which lived realities can be understood. Exploring the ways in which personal agency and individualism are set against structural inequalities, make it possible to unravel some of the experiences of this under-researched group.

Indeed, race frames and informs the context, practices and perspectives of everyday lived experiences in society and schools - even in those instances when race is not expressly recognised. In the case of ethnographic research, race emerges as a pivotal factor that is often undertheorised and sometimes unacknowledged. Though ethnographic research seeks to illuminate 'culture', and often does so in the context of research inquiries that are both racialised and that occur with researchers and participants who come from different racial backgrounds, this work often fails to place race at the centre. Drawing from data collected in a multi-sited ethnographic study on risk and academic achievement and using key insights from narrative inquiry and critical race theory in education, this paper examines how the construct of race informed and illuminated the research process for a Black female researcher whose participants were White. Findings highlight four areas of the research process implicated by race and the different racial positionalities' of the researcher and participants directly and indirectly connected to the study. These areas include: (1) identifying a relevant research question; (2) locating a research site; (3) making sense of the research context; and (4) navigating context, generating data, and managing relationships in the research site.

Pointing out a number of relevant indications and reflections that qualify such debate, she argues that the concern of Italian researchers, educators and citizens about the resurgence of racism must be understood with reference to the historical, philosophical and scientific perspectives that aimed to disunite humanity, on the one hand; on the other, in the light of Italy's history of racist ideology and its impact on education, during Fascism. Both research paths justified exclusion and exploitation of populations on the basis of a naturalistic classification whose null denotation has been definitely proved by recent biological and genetic evidence. In the second part, and with regard to contemporary times and changes brought about by immigration to Italy, the author presents and comments Italian legislation on the education of immigrant children and underlines how it views diversity as a resource and an asset that can promote mutual respect and intercultural dialogue in multicultural classrooms. However she warns about the risk of naturalising ethnic and cultural diversity and fixing the new pupils and students, as well as their families, to predetermined cultural 'scripts'. Acknowledging that the perspective of anthropology of education and the ethnographic approach are of relevance in understanding the complexity of teacher-pupils and peer interaction in a multicultural classroom as well as the influence of the cultural rules and habits of the school on learning by immigrants' or Roma children, she supports her view through ethnographic research conducted among Sikh youth in the North and among the Roma in a Turin school. Her conclusions stress the intellectual contribution of ethnographic research to a thorough questioning of 'race' and 'racial' theories and of naturalisation of cultures. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Ethnographic research; History of racism in Italy; Racism",,"Gobbo, F.; Department of Education and Training, University of Turin, Turin, Italy; email: francesca.gobbo@unito.it",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

I define a racial motif as a central theme or story used to make sense of the social and educational experiences of a racial group. I argue that long-standing racial motifs inform how ethnographic research is conducted within a historical context, and how the theories that come out of ethnographic research inform how we understand the social and educational concerns of African-American males in the present. In other words, past constructions and theories close off the kinds of questions one can ask within a particular historical period and limit how contemporary questions are explored. In this paper, I show how ethnographies written during the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s were constructed in a way that was aligned with the dominant tropes and theories about Black males during those decades. I additionally show how these same theories and tropes were visible in television programs and movies. I conclude by discussing both the challenges and the promise of ethnography, including how educational ethnographers can explore new questions that challenge historically entrenched racial motifs.

The term (im)migrant(s) is used instead and the relationships in education between Scandinavians and (im)migrants and between educational results and (im)migrant culture and/or languages are often in focus. Integration has also been an issue. History may give an indication as to how this may have become so. Research on immigrants, immigration and integration has been promoted in national policies and these policies highlight language, culture and diversity but for historical and political reasons they often avoid ethnicity and ignore race and colour altogether. Moreover, when ethnicity is used it seems to be used more as an ontological marker than as an epistemological concept.

Through a sustained intertextual dialogue with William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying (1930) in which she ""Signifies"" on the verb ""to pass,"" Parks resurrects two specific black female bodies: Willa Mae Beede, who passes as white, and her former lover Dill Smiles, who passes as male. Read in this way, Getting Mother's Body is dialogic, more like a play than a novel in that it engages in a continual call and response between various internal and external audiences who in turn are made up of characters and writers, both living and dead. Furthermore, while it continually posits both its own fictional status (insofar as it pays such clear homage to Faulkner's novel) and the fluid nature of race and sexuality, the novel stages an overt performance of gendered identity that extends Faulkner's work beyond the realm of white, heterosexual identification. This essay is significant in that it seeks to link Parks's only novel to her theatrical works that preceded it and to foreground subsequent discussion of Getting Mother's Body through a careful analysis of its intertextual relationship to As I Lay Dying. © University of Tulsa, 2011.

A pervasive tendency among contemporary critics has been to dismiss these poems as engaged in the conventions of mawkish, sentimental anthropomorphism that modernist writers, lauded for inaugurating a process of seriously rethinking human and nonhuman animal relations in terms of reciprocity and responsibility, are seen to debunk. This view has forestalled any real analysis of how Victorian women writers themselves, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning in particular, actively inquired into the epistemology and phenomenology of love across the species divide. This paper argues that Barrett Browning's poems about-and frequent references in her letters to-her cocker spaniel Flush, which have frequently been looked on with embarrassment by literary critics and biographers alike, are actually contiguous with the theoretical concerns about love, kinship, and intimacy that occupy much of her literary and epistolary output. © University of Tulsa, 2011.

University administrators and faculty members, however, have been slow to recognize that systemically gendered barriers will have to be reduced or eliminated in order for women faculty to advance in their careers. One key problem is that many, if not most, leaders in powerful decision-making roles in universities continue to embrace women-centred explanations for gender disparities in advancement through the academic ranks. University leaders' lack of recognition of institutionalized gender barriers suggests the need for greater dissemination of research findings (and training) about how systemic barriers operate and why these barriers disproportionately disadvantage women. In this article I first theorize universities as incongruous, gendered bureaucratic structures. I then outline an intervention strategy for enabling university faculty members and administrators to see incongruous, gendered bureaucratic structures and to then use this knowledge to develop strategies for addressing the problem of women's underrepresentation among science and engineering faculty. The strategy described is a case-study approach recently implemented at a mid-sized research-intensive university in the US Midwest. The workshop was part of a broader university programme aimed at transforming the university's cultures, practices and structures in ways that help to enhance the recruitment, retention and promotion of women scientists. I conclude by discussing the benefits and limitations of the case-study approach as a method for unsettling accepted knowledge about the gendered structures and normative practices of the university. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Benevolent sexism; Collaborative transformation; Gendered organizations; Incongruous gendered bureaucratic structures; Subtle gender bias","academic research; administration; bureaucracy; decision making; gender disparity; teaching; university sector; womens status; Midwest; United States","Bird, S.R.; Department of Sociology, Iowa State University, 217B East Hall, Ames, IA 50011, United States; email: sbird@iastate.edu",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951780014

In accountancy internal segregation by sex is considerably less evident but women fail to rise through organizational hierarchies. Qualitative interviews with qualified doctors and accountants suggest that sex discrimination is to some extent still an issue but that the major factor underlying these different gendered career trajectories is that women still retain the major responsibility for domestic work and caring. They also suggest that doctors have been able to exercise more control over their working hours than accountants and that even when accountants work part-time, they work longer hours than contracted. Part-time work is also seen as seriously career-limiting.

The article draws on individual semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 couples aged between 20 and 35, identified as a sample of the population that has the resources to capitalise on modern opportunities for gender equality in heterosexual relationships. Although all of the couples claim to aspire to equality, this translates into practice for only one of the couples interviewed. The research findings indicate that a number of the couples employ similar justifications, with both male and female respondents arguing that women have higher standards and are more competent performers of household chores, and that the division of labour is practical, based on the hours worked by both partners. The paper concludes that while couples continue to expend their time and effort in defending and justifying inequality, rather than in working to challenge it, heterosexual relationships will continue to be overwhelmed by traditional gender roles. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Domestic labour; Foodwork; Gender; Gender inequality; Heterosexuality; Housework",,"van Hooff, J.

Specifically, membership categorisation analysis is deployed to explore how the relatively new (and perhaps alternative) category for men - 'metrosexual' - is presented and received. Our analysis suggests that masculinity concerns are central in debates about 'metrosexuality', with self-identified 'metrosexuals' invoking heterosexual prowess and self-respect on the one hand, and critics (e.g. self-identified 'real men') lamenting 'metrosexuality' for its perceived effeminacy and lack of authenticity on the other.

Findings reveal that men occupy a range of important roles in screening both as supporters of their pregnant partners and as potential fathers. They also revealed however that men's participation is often inhibited by existing institutional and organisational factors including the attitudes of health professionals and workplace norms, both of which continue to be influenced by traditional gender role ideology.

Conflicts between the claims of women's equality and the claims of religion are well-documented vis- vis all major religions and across all regions. The ongoing moral panic about the presence of Islam in Europe, marked by a preoccupation with policing Muslim women's dress, reminds us of the centrality of women and gender power relations in the interrelation of religion, culture and the state. Added to postmodern and other critiques of the secular-religious binary, most sociological research now contradicts the equation of modernization with secularization. This article focuses on the challenges that these developments pose to politically oriented feminist thinking and practice. It argues that non-oppressive feminist responses require a new critical engagement with secularism as a normative principle in democratic, multicultural societies. To inform this process, the author maps and links discussions across different fields of feminist scholarship, in the sociology of religion and in political theory. She organizes the main philosophical traditions and fault lines that form the intellectual terrain at the intersection of feminism, religion and politics in two broad groups: feminist critiques of the Enlightenment critique of religion; and feminist scholarship at the critical edges of the Enlightenment tradition. The author argues that notwithstanding the fragmented nature of feminist debates in this area, common ground is emerging across different politically oriented approaches: all emphasize democracy and the values that underpin it as the larger discursive frame in which the principle of secularism can be redefined with emancipatory intent in a neo-secular age. © 2011 Feminist Review.","equality; feminism; multiculturalism; religion; rights; secularism",,"Reilly, N.; Department of Women's Studies, School of Political Science and Sociology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Women's experiences of activism are at the centre of this account, which highlights their attempts to economically and socially develop a destitute rural community. Their development ideals mirror the embedded principles of liberal secular modernity and offer a tangible example of the concomitance of these so-called binaries of religion and secularism in women's religious activism. Normative assumptions regarding religion and secularism as two binary constructs have largely dictated a monolithic view of women who engage in Islamic activism as religious subjects primarily devoted to a spiritual, internal faith. Persistent models of religious selves engaged in a continuous exercise of self-fashioning towards a fixed religious ideal overlook the complexity and seamlessness of the desires that animate these subjectivities. Moreover, it is inaccurate to represent participants in Islamic activism as homogenized into one overarching group that adheres to standardized religious membership criteria. Discourses of modernity have also constructed separate spheres of what is defined as religion and secularism. Yet, these spheres, in practice, are not always so neatly demarcated as they are in modern principles. Societies shaped by the historical and temporal dynamics of colonialism, modernization, secularization and nation building projects present more complex and heterogeneous forms of subjectivities in their members. This article illustrates how a theoretical concomitance of religion and secularism opens up new possible considerations of women's activism in Islamic movements. The author argues that the desires and subjectivities of Islamic women that inform their activism are ultimately linked to the historical emergence of secularism and state modernization schemes aimed at transforming Muslim subjects into modern citizens of liberal democracies. © 2011 Feminist Review.","development; Islam; muslim women; secularism/religion critique; subjectivity",,"Hafez, S.; University of California, Riverside, United States",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Thousands of men and women across the globe uploaded their own videos to YouTube to criticize or support the film. In this article, we look at these alternative videos from a feminist perspective, contrasting the gender portrayal and narratives in Fitna with those in the alternative videos. We contend that Fitna expressed an extremist Orientalist discourse, in which women are presented as the current and future victims of the oppression of Muslim men and Islam. In contrast, the YouTube videos give voice to women themselves who come from across the globe, are relatively young and often active Muslims. Second, they express different view points in generically new ways, criticizing and ridiculing Wilders or producing serious and committed explanations of their own understanding of Islam. Third, although relatively few women appeared in the videos, those that did speak for themselves, not only take on Wilders, but also claim their right to speak within Islam. We propose to understand these videos as acts of citizenships through which women constitute themselves as global citizens, in some cases by engaging in deliberation as it is understood in feminist political theory, in other cases by taking a voice that can be responded to. © 2011 Feminist Review.","Citizenship; Fitna; Gender, Islam; religion; YouTube",,"Vis, F.; University of LeicesterUnited Kingdom",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

Based on in-depth interviews with seventeen mothers ordained in the Church, this paper will focus on how the sacred-profane boundary is managed. Priests who are mothers have a particular insight into the Church hierarchy as they symbolically straddle the competing discourses of sacred and profane. However, instead of reifying these binaries, the experiences of these women show how such dualisms are challenged and managed in everyday life. Indeed, in terms of experience, ritual, ministry and preaching, priests who are mothers are resisting, recasting and renegotiating sacred terrain in subtle and nuanced ways.

Their work suggests that time is not an apolitical background to social life, but shapes how we perceive and relate to others. For those interested in exploring issues such as identity, community and difference, this suggests that attending to how temporal discourses are utilised in relation to these issues is a key task. This article seeks to contribute to an expansion of the debate about time and sociality by contributing an analysis of a variety of ways in which Gloria Anzaldúa utilises temporal concepts as part of her work of rethinking social identity and community. In particular, I suggest that in contesting homogeneous identity, Anzaldúa also implicitly contests linear temporal frameworks. Further, in creating new frameworks for identity, I suggest the possibility of discerning an alternative approach to time in her work that places difference at the heart of simultaneity. I suggest that the interconnection between concepts of time and community within Anzaldúas work indicates, more broadly, that attempts to rework understandings of relationality must be accompanied by reworked accounts of temporality. © 2011 Feminist Review.","activism; Anzaldúa; community; difference; time",,"Bastian, M.; Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change, University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom",,,01417789,,,,"English","Fem.

On the basis of anthropological research in Israel and the Philippines, it analyses Filipina care workers narratives of migration to Israel as a form of spiritual transformation, investigating their spiritual practices and emphasis on Christian morals like compassion and patience for their work. Israel, a country that has recruited Filipinos as carers for the elderly since the 1990s, is a destination country highly valued among Filipino Christians as the Holy Land. Focusing on evangelical Christians, the article portrays four women for whom migration to Israel signifies an ethical career: turning into Holy Land pilgrims, Christ-like activists and missionaries, they are engaged in a deeply self-transforming journey. Rooting themselves in Christian spiritualities and morals, these women negotiate and inhabit rather than openly challenge existing gender norms.

It is largely taken to be of little critical interest, as simply to be equated with heteronormativity. The present conflation of heterosexuality with heteronormativity presents dominant practices as monolithic, as all of a piece, and unchanging. In other words, the conflation over-determines this sexual mode as a source of domination and under-theorises it as a site for social dissonance or even a potential source of subversion. This paper, by contrast, considers the term transgression in relation to heterosexuality and in particular to heterosex. It is asserted that transgression might be intrinsic within dominant practices like heterosexuality (rather than necessarily always external to them). In the process the potential of the term transgression is compared with other terms like subversion/dissent/protest. The term is explored in the context of heterosexuality by drawing upon a range of resources such as analyses arising from environmental politics, Deleuze's conception of 'becoming', accounts which foreground ethical considerations (Carmody; Jenkins; White) and the notion of 'social flesh'. This discussion leads to the question of what might transgression in the realm of the dominant look like; how might a transgressive heterosexuality be conceptualised?

Using work on the 'missing discourse' of female desire, it is noted that a normative understanding of heterosexuality still allocates the ownership of desire along gender lines, where young men can claim sexual agency as an integral part of their identity, whereas young women are pressured to disavow their own desire if they are to be accepted as 'good girls'. In this context Twilight articulates a fantasy of claiming a carnality and sexual subjectivity for its heroine through her association with a supernatural 'beast'*Edward Cullen, a vampire. Twilight is positioned as one title in a growing publishing sub-category of Young Adult supernatural romance in which young female characters claim a sexuality that transgresses heterosexual norms by forming erotic ties with human creature hybrids. It is argued that, despite its conservative features, Twilight is an attempt to inscribe this 'missing discourse' of female desire through a reclaiming of the beast's sexuality for its heroine. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.",,,"Diamond, F.; English Department, Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne, Australia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

However, examination of systems change and whether particular social change efforts (e.g., coordinating councils) contribute to such change is a notoriously difficult research endeavor due in large part to methodological barriers, including those that stem from nonexperimental designs and complex data that are characterized as nested and measured in proportions. This article describes important methodological challenges and proposes innovative techniques to address these challenges. Specifically, multilevel modeling is applied to examine two key systems markers, including protection order and domestic violence program referral rates over time in one state.

This research adds to the current literature by experimentally assessing participants' views of fathers who take leave in addition to mothers who take leave. We used an undergraduate sample (N = 167) from a small regional university in the Midwestern United States to assess participants' reactions to scenarios involving a mother or a father who went back to work immediately, took a 12-week leave, or stayed at home with the child indefinitely. The results showed that parents who took leave were rated more positively than stay-at-home parents and working parents. Parents who took leave were also rated as more competent than stay-at-home parents and more warm than working parents. Further, parents who took leave were expected to be less successful in their careers than working parents but more successful than parents who stayed at home. Participants had a more favorable overall impression of parents who took leave when that parent was of the same gender as themselves. Additionally, female participants were more favorable about mothers and fathers breaking traditional gender roles than were male participants.

We investigated whether these gender double standards interact with an age double standard that describes the elderly as less sexual than the young, to create particularly limiting sexual standards for older women. 305 Canadian undergraduates completed a 2 (target age) × 2 (target gender) × 2 (participant gender) within-subjects study measuring perceptions of younger (own age) and older (over 65 years old) men's and women's interest in traditional sex (e. g., cuddling, intercourse with main partner) and experimental sex (e. g., extra-relationship sex, viewing erotic materials). ANCOVAs controlling for ageist and sexist beliefs revealed the ageist double standard; the elderly were perceived to be less interested in sex overall than the young. There was also a sexual double standard; women were perceived to be more interested in traditional sex than men, and men more interested in experimental sex than women. For traditional sex, women perceived younger targets as more interested than the older targets, and women targets as more interested than men. For experimental sex, a three-way interaction showed the interplay between the sexual and ageist double standards. Elderly female targets were perceived as least interested, and young male targets as most interested.

Unlike past work which has examined these factors individually, we study them simultaneously to better understand how they co-occur in the real world. One hundred and five female and 74 male U. S. students from a university in New England read a short description of a female college student's experience of rape and answered questions about their reactions. Results demonstrate that female participants reported higher attitudes towards feminism, lower rape myth acceptance attitudes, higher attributions of fault to society for the rape, and higher feelings of anger and fear in response to the rape than male participants. Further, gender, attitudes towards feminism, rape myth acceptance attitudes, attributions of fault to society, and fear emerged as predictors of desire to engage in anti-rape collective action. In contrast, gender, rape myth acceptance attitudes, attributions of fault to the male perpetrator, and anger emerged as predictors of reported likelihood of helping the survivor of rape. Results suggest that although female college students are more likely to intend to engage in anti-rape collective action and help survivors of rape, the processes whereby attitudes, attributions of fault, and emotions relate to intended responses to rape are largely similar for female and male college students. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Attributions of fault; Collective action; Feminist attitudes; Helping; Rape",,"Earnshaw, V.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors draw on results from an empirical investigation involving 1,731 questionnaires investigating the attitudes of women and men in a town in the north of Sweden. Findings – The tentative conclusions suggest that even if they appear to co-exist in contradictory ways, ideas of gender-appropriate domestic responsibilities and equality of opportunity are in the respondents' minds, alongside neo-liberal notions of individualisation. The prevailing attitudes in respect of gender suggest that women and men make apparently free “choices”; the influence of age on attitudes to gender issues is also considered. Originality/value – This paper considers neo-liberalisation and its impact on gender equity in Sweden, a country with a strong reputation for gender equity and a tradition of collective, inclusive social democracy, somewhere we would be unlikely to find its embedded presence. Using a quantitative self-reporting approach to attitudes relevant to the choices made by men and women, the study raises questions about gender-appropriate domestic responsibilities and equality of opportunity in a country that has been and continues to be regarded as one of the most gender-friendly in the world and likely to be resistant to the influence of neo-liberalism. The implications are explored, with the evidence indicating the presence of neo-liberalism co-existing, albeit perhaps uneasily, with traditions of equality of opportunity and attitudes to gender. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Equal opportunities; Family roles; Gender; Responsibilities; Sweden",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach – The research is qualitative in nature. A total of 32 in-depth face-to face interviews were conducted with 32 women managers. Findings – Interview data reveal that Lebanese women managers do not perceive gender-centered factors as obstacles to career advancement. The women in the study used different terms to describe the impact of gender, work, and family factors on their career progression to those found in existing literature. Their responsibilities towards their families were not perceived as barriers hindering their career progress. In addition, their personality traits, aspirations for management, levels of educational attainment and work experience, and family-related factors were also not perceived as inhibiting their careers. Practical implications – The paper provides new practical insights into the relationships and the interconnections between Arab society, women, and their managerial careers. A strong theme is the significant role of Wasta, the reliance and dependence on social connections versus personal education and achievements to achieve career progress, in enhancing career progression and how gender is less of a criterion in the presence of Wasta.

The research centred on an ethnographic study carried out at the 'Britain's Strongest Man' 2007 competition. The article argues that, while strength athletic events may be viewed by some as 'freak shows' or 'circuses', this perception is strongly contested by the organisers of and participants in such competitions who, in contrast, view their sport as part of mainstream sporting culture. Strength athletics is, however, highly dependent on television coverage, both for its continued existence and for its manner of representation. The article discusses the attitudes of production personnel, as well as contestants, to the nature of the sport, the presentation of the sporting body within hegemonic masculinity and in the context of discipline and health, and the importance of place. The ambivalence involved in the presentation of a healthy body is noted. With relation to the presentation of gender, the study concludes that a particular style of 'gentlemanly' masculinity is performed by competitors, this being related to heteronormative assumptions that both reinforce, and are reinforced by, the character of the place of the competition.","Body; Masculinity; Place; Strength athletics; Strong man; Television sport","body size; cultural influence; gender identity; gender role; health belief; hegemony; perception; research work; United Kingdom","Tivers, J.; School of Arts and Humanities, Nottingham Trent University, Burton Street, Nottingham, United Kingdom",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751669056

This compounds the physical constraints imposed by poor accessibility (to services and markets) associated with poor roads and inadequate transport in both direct and more complex ways.

Findings: The analyses indicate that differences in tee box placement between men's and women's tees did predict differences in participation and salaries in networking-oriented professions. It was found that the greater the distance between men's and women's tees, the lower the salaries and participation rate for women. This effect was greatest for the marketing and sales profession.

Further research might include observational studies of mixed-gender golf groups, and might also explore whether women choose not to pursue networking occupations or women are not selected for jobs that require networking on the golf course. Social implications: Companies should be aware of how venues selected for networking might have disparate impacts for men and women, and select venues that are as gender-neutral as possible. Originality/value: This paper is, to the authors' knowledge, the first empirical investigation of gender relations in non-traditional work settings with female participation and earnings in occupations that require networking for career success. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Discrimination; Gender; Golf courses; Networking; Sports; Women",,"Del Campo, R.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on the firm characteristics that predict the sex of the executive office holder, classifying the plausible firm characteristics that could explain the presence of female executives into four explanations: sector, size, stability, and scandal. Design/methodology/approach: This paper provides perhaps the first large-sample analyses of the sex of executive officers in Fortune 500 firms by analyzing a sample of 3,691 executives in 444 Fortune 500 companies. Findings: In the paper's sample, 252 of the executives, or 6.4 percent of the sample, are women. The authors' analyses reveal that women are less likely to be chief executive officers and chief operations officers, but more likely to be chief corporate officers and general counsels. Female executives are somewhat less likely to be present in the construction sector, but there is evidence that they are more likely to be present in retail trade. Firms with greater assets and sales growth are less likely to have female executives. Using originally collected data, it is shown that firms that have experienced a scandal in recent years are more likely to have female executives. However, the nature and quantity of scandals do not have significant effects. Originality/value: Ultimately, the authors' analyses reveal that key firm characteristics predict whether an executive office is held by a woman. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Fortune 500 companies; Gender; United States of America; Women executives",,"Brady, D.; Duke University, Durham, NC, United States; email: brady@soc.duke.edu",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952346264

The ideograph 'women-and-children' is often evoked and added to the hegemonic foreign policy rhetoric without questioning the actual rhetorical work it does.

It argues that at the beginning of the 21st century the more traditional spotlight on the country's natural attractions was altered, giving an additional, new focus on the nation's beautiful, and apparently sexually promiscuous, women. Such a development deserves further comment for a variety of reasons. First, an examination of the importance of women to Iceland's national marketing, especially their depiction visually, underlines the need to reconsider the substantial role of gender and imagery representation in tourism studies, two themes that have been underexamined by scholars working in the discipline. Second, as a Nordic nation with a reputation for gender equality, this focus on women as sexual objects readily available for male tourist consumption raises a serious contradiction. Last but not least, the use of sexually alluring female images by a developed nation has intriguing implications for postcolonial scholars interested in representations of 'the Other'. While shying away from implying that ideologies of 'race' are not important to discussions of international sex tourism, this article suggests that gender should be considered an equally important contributing factor in such analyses. © The Author(s) 2011.","gender; Iceland; imagery; politics; postcolonialism; sex; tourism",,"Alessio, D.; Richmond the American International University in London, 7 Ansdell Street, Kensington, London W8 5BN, United Kingdom; email: alessid@richmond.ac.uk",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

In contrast, this article illuminates the significance of class for late modern sexualities by taking a'cultural' approach to the issue. By analysing gay men's personal accounts of class (dis-)identification that were told in interviews in Britain, the article elucidates the ways in which class and sexuality were articulated as intertwined, and how class and gay identities were constructed relationally through each other. Specifically, it generates insights into the performativities of classed gay identities; the differential value attached to working- and middle-class identities; and how narratives of (dis)identification often articulate gay and working class identities as relational'Others'. Contrary to some theoretical and popular notions of gay identities as classless, my analysis shows that class identities can be centrally important to gay ones. While the relationship between gay classed identities and socio-economic positioning is not straightforward, such identities illuminate how cultural, social and economic (dis-)incentives promote distancing from'working-class' forms of existence and strong attachments to'middle-class' ones and to the idea of gay class transcendence.

A 90-day, design-driven feasibility study examined daily telephone data collection, daily paper diaries, and monthly retrospective semistructured interview methods among a community sample of 123 women currently experiencing IPV to study within-person relationships between IPV and substance use.

The context for our overview is how operational definitions of rape have evolved, where consensus has emerged, and where it eludes the field. We discuss two approaches to the detection of rape victimization in survey methods, namely behaviorally specific questions and a new, two-stage approach, and how each can be evaluated in terms of validity. We point out promises and pitfalls of the two-stage approach and make suggestions for its implementation and evaluation. We conclude that all empirical research to date supports the use of behaviorally specific compared to broad questions, that a standard definition of rape and its components of act, tactics, and nonconsent is imperative to move the field forward, and that research to systematically validate methods of detecting rape victimization is needed. To that end, we propose an agenda. © The Author(s) 2011.","construct validity; measurement; rape; self-report","article; female; human; human relation; information processing; interview; male; methodology; rape; sexual behavior; statistics; victim; Crime Victims; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Interviews as Topic; Male; Rape; Sexual Behavior","Cook, S.

A few themes and some overarching lessons emerge from the wide variety of data presented. First, it is clear that women are under-represented across a range of media and settings. Second, when women are portrayed, it is often in a circumscribed and negative manner. Women are often sexualized-typically by showing them in scanty or provocative clothing. Women are also subordinated in various ways, as indicated by their facial expressions, body positions, and other factors. Finally, they are shown in traditionally feminine (i. e., stereotyped) roles. Women are portrayed as nonprofessionals, homemakers, wives or parents, and sexual gatekeepers. Although the studies generally support these conclusions, some interesting moderating factors are identified, such as race. It is suggested that next steps involve the development of theory and a body of empirical evidence regarding the effects of exposure to under-representation of women. Data concerning the effects of exposure to sexualized or stereotypical portrayals on young audiences is also lacking. Finally, content analyses of new media, including those created and distributed by users, are recommended as a next step. It is concluded that, while increasing the representation of women in media may be valuable, it is also critical that the manner in which they are portrayed be simultaneously considered to avoid increasing negative or stereotypical depictions that may be particularly harmful to viewers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Content analysis; Gender roles; Media effects; Sex",,"Collins, R.

These campaigns situate their critiques of heterosexuality outside conventional heterosexual intimacy and marriage by carving off an allegedly unique and dangerous zone (in public, for money, at the hands of strangers) in which sex is exchanged for money and livelihood. These efforts to ""draw the line"" between disapproved and expected forms of exploitation and inequality (sexual and nonsexual) are filled with contradiction and incoherence, particularly in regard to the sexual culpability of men or women. Recent international law (2000) recasts trafficking by defining it as a crime of labor exploitation (not prostitution) that can harm any person (not just women and girls). Despite this reframing, the melodramatic narrative used to tell the story of trafficking subverts the new laws by highlighting sexual danger, innocent women, and male lust as the causal factors in trafficking. Critiques of heterosexual intimacy, institutions, and economies are redirected to the exceptional and the sexual in contemporary campaigns against trafficking, despite the progressive elements of recent law. © 2010 by Duke University Press.",,,"Vance, C.

Biographical transitions between work and non-work are analysed, paying specific attention to the processes of gender positioning. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on the analysis of 60 narrative interviews with men and women working in the Italian public sector (the civil service and the health service). The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and then subjected to narrative analysis, focusing in particular on plots, biographical transitions and positioning processes. Findings – The analysis has brought out the predominant plots, as well as the alternative ones, of the work stories narrated by men and women interviewed, highlighting the specific gender positioning that subtended different attributions between men and women in the inter-relations between work and the personal and familial sphere. Practical implications – The results show the opportunity to focus next research on organizations that use managerial models innovative in terms of time organization and performance assessment, giving visibility and legitimacy to alternative narratives on the interweaving among people's different biographical trajectories. Originality/value – The paper proposes the concept of “biographical transition” as an interpretative category with which to study the different strategies and experiences of work/life balance and an heuristic tool able to give sense to the complex interweaving among different life trajectories in the contemporary society. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Employee attitudes; Gender; Italy; Narratives; Public sector organizations",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Our results show that (1) there is some evidence for gender display in rural China and Taiwan, but not in urban China, and (2) the evidence for gender display is more pronounced in Taiwan than in rural China.

Early IQ researchers, such as Terman and Goddard, hypothesised that IQ was necessary for sexual morality and tested the hypothesis that prostitutes had lower IQ than other women. Terman was further concerned that gifted children not be 'queer' and appealed to a Freudian logic of sublimation to explain why children whom he deemed gifted sometimes engaged in homosexual acts. Intelligence testing is not simply a 'disciplinary' form of power/knowledge of the sort described by Foucault in Discipline and Punish; it is not oriented towards normalising 'gifted' people that it individualises. Rather, gifted people are made visible within a strategy of changing government to accommodate their difference from typical intelligence.

Importantly, postmodernism interrogates the dynamics of power, calling into question the relationship between therapist and client by challenging the notion of therapist authority in relation to their clients. With regard to queer theory in particular, previous notions of gender and sexual categories have been deemed thoroughly unhinged from essentialist modes in exchange for wholly socially constructed ones; identities based on gender and sexuality are thereby seen as specifying and limiting. Many queer theorists encourage a postmodern perspective within psychotherapy where identities are subverted and undermined in the name of freeing individuals and society at large - 'fluidity' is seen as the developmentally desired position. Psychotherapists, however, must ask whether the paradigm of fluidity and the deconstruction of identities are simply replacing one powerful discourse with another. Furthermore, should a discourse that comes from a philosophical/political background (one that is a-clinical) inform therapeutic practice? How psychotherapeutic practice and theory can take on the insights of queer theory while at the same time honour the phenomenological experience of clients, which frequently adheres to strong notions of gender and sexual identity, will be of great importance. Queer insights cannot be applied to psychotherapy in toto. A relational approach to rework postmodern theory in relation to the practice of psychotherapy is needed: one that reassesses the relationship of post-Foucaultian gender theorising in relation to an understanding that gender and sexual identities in addition to being specifying can also be personally and politically liberating. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Fluidity; Foucault; Gender theory; Identity; Postmodernism; Psychotherapy; Queer theory; Relational psychoanalysis; Sexuality",,"Balick, A.; Centre for Psychoanalytic Studies, University of Essex, Wivenhoe Park, Colchester, United Kingdom; email: ajbali@essex.ac.uk",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

Building on work in the field of narrative therapy in productive ways, I explore four case studies from my own practice to elaborate an approach to counselling in relation to issues of gender, sexuality and identity that (1) recognises the operations of top-down power both within the counselling space and in the world more broadly, (2) understands individuals as a 'fold' of the social and (3) holds practitioners to account for the evidentiary claims that we make. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Accountability; Counselling; Evidence; Power; Queering; Subjectivity",,"Riggs, D.

So, how might queer theory guide research and practice in public mental health services (PMHS)? Within the research on mental health issues for lesbians, gays and bisexuals (LGB) there are calls for making mental health services more LGB affirmative. Mostly this scholarship is from the field of 'lesbian and gay psychology'. This tends to have an individualistic, positivist and essentialising focus. As such, it is limited in exploring how heteronormative cultural discourses impact on research, mental health systems and clinical practice. For example, common recommendations include separate LGB services and matching clients and clinicians along sexual orientation lines. Utilising a queer perspective on the homo/hetero binary, this article argues that such strategies are minoritising, in that they make homosexuality relevant to only a minority of clients and staff. When applied to mental health practice, minoritising strategies have limited scope to effect change for the wide group of same-sex attracted clients within PMHS. Based on research with same-sex attracted clients and staff of PHMS in Aotearoa/New Zealand, this article explores how a queer theoretical perspective can usefully inform research and clinical practice in ways that affirm queerness by questioning heteronormativity. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Lesbian, gay and bisexual; Mental health; Public mental health services; Queer theory",,"Semp, D.; Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand; email: dsemp@ihug.co.nz",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

The aim is to address the question of which kinds of subjects are enabled, and which are made invisible, through discursive and clinical practices. The analysis demonstrates the conceptual value of drawing on discursive and queer theoretical approaches. The published work of selected clinicians is used as a way in to the complexities that various clinical understandings and approaches bring with them. A key focus is on problems inherent in the construction of gender variant youth as 'persisting' or 'desisting' in their cross-gender wishes. Psychologists working in this area have substantial challenges to face, such as the challenge of negotiating understandings about what is a 'successful' outcome and the complexity of reporting fluidity and uncertainty in the context of a scientific forum where 'results' are expected. This article addresses the challenge of engaging psychological, discursive and clinical practices in ways that enable empowered, viable, gender variant possibilities, rather than representing gender variant youth as incoherent subjects. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Discourse; Gender identity disorder; Gender variant youth; Puberty suppression; Queer",,"Roen, K.; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; email: katrina.roen@psykologi.uio.no",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

Few differences are found in comparisons of health outcomes based on age at first sexual victimization (childhood vs. adulthood). Furthermore, men with histories of sexual victimization report healthier coping skills than men with no histories of sexual victimization, but no significant group differences are found in social support or stress-related growth.

However, very little is known about the relational risk and resilience factors of married and cohabiting African American men and their partners after their release from prison. More specifically, there is a lack of data that addresses the qualitative responses of married and cohabiting African Americans regarding the following seven dimensions: (a) factors associated with initial attraction; (b) feelings when they realized they were in a ""coupled"" relationship; (c) post-cohabitation adjustments; (d) the meaning of commitment; (e) perceptions regarding how being in a relationship changed their lives; (f) perceptions regarding how the relationship expanded the couple's view of commitment; as well as (g) couple perceptions regarding the future of their relationship. To address this paucity, this paper will feature narratives provided by two previously incarcerated African American men (one married; one cohabiting) and their partners. Qualitative analyses of the data resulted in risk and resilience themes related to each of the aforementioned dimensions. Themes were related to the start of the relationship, perceptions regarding in a ""coupled"" relationship, psychological and behavioral changes after cohabitation, the definition and demonstration of commitment, how being in a relationship positively changed the lives of these couples, broadened how they think about commitment, as well as confidence regarding the future of their relationship. Supporting qualitative data are presented in connection with each theme.

In addition, we explored the role of age in women's sexual activities and satisfaction levels. A total of 4,470 heterosexual Dutch women participated in this study, ranging in age from 18 to 82. Results indicated that, on average, women were quite satisfied with their sex lives and engaged, on a regular basis, in several sexual activities. A minority of women engaged in extradyadic sex and cybersex. With age, women were especially less likely to have sex with a partner and, when having sex, to engage in oral sex. Older women also felt less satisfied with the quality of their sex lives.

However, the role that narrative research has played in social policy-making efforts has been small compared to that of quantitative research. This paper highlights the ways in which theoretical stances, questions, methods, and findings from narrative research can be useful in social policy-making arenas. Particular attention is paid to research conducted in the narrative study of lives tradition in psychology, gerontology, and related social sciences. Narrative research that seeks to understand individual lives in all their complexity and in the contexts in which they are lived can be particularly useful in informing sexuality-related policy concerns given the complex nature of sexuality. By focusing on the current policy concern of same-sex relationship recognition, this paper demonstrates that (a) narrative research offers much to the study of social policy and social justice via its ability to illuminate the complex interplay between everyday lived experience and social structures and (b) there is a need to redefine what counts as research evidence in policy-making efforts to be more inclusive of narrative work. In making these arguments, examples of recent narrative research are highlighted regarding their direct relevance to sexuality-related social policy. The paper concludes with suggestions by which researchers and policy makers can productively incorporate narrative research into their work by focusing on the complimentary potential for findings from quantitative and narrative research. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Narrative research; Same-sex relationships; Sexuality; Social policy; Social sciences",,"Frost, D.M.; San Francisco State University, 835 Market Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States; email: frost@sfsu.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

The most recent case is the policy of restricting teen girls' access to emergency contraception, which is now available overthe- counter (i.e., without a prescription) to women over the age of 18. Using the case of emergency contraception as an example, the author discusses how contemporary reproductive health policy in the USA is not only influenced by this history of governmental regulation but also by the ingrained cultural fears and anxieties about teenage sexuality and reproduction that motivate these actions. The author shows how policy narrative analysis in particular was a useful tool in revealing assumptions driving the policy to restrict teen girls' access to emergency contraception, and how it allowed her to predict that teen girls would be placed at the center of debate when many of her reproductive health colleagues mistakenly assumed that emergency contraception would be granted over-the-counter status without controversy. © Springer Science+Business Media.","Adolescent girls; Emergency contraception; Narrative analysis; Reproductive health; Social policy",,"Price, K.; Department of Women's Studies, San Diego State University, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182-6030, United States; email: kprice@mail.sdsu.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

Using illustrative evidence from a study of autobiographies of gay men spanning a 60-year period and a study of the life stories of contemporary same-sex attracted youth, we detail the implications of historic silence, exclusion, and subordination for the life course. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.","Bisexual; Discrimination; Exclusion; Gay; Homosexuality; Lesbian; Narrative; Sexual identity; Social policy; Voice and silence",,"Hammack, P.L.; Department of Psychology, University of California, Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, United States; email: hammack@ucsc.edu",,"Springer New York LLC",18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

Evidence suggests an alarming rise in the number of false allegations of sexual abuse being made against teachers and demonstrates that the fallout from being falsely accused is far-reaching and sometimes tragic. In the UK, master narratives which influence and shape child protection policies and procedures privilege the stories told by accusers and, in effect, silence the accused who are considered guilty until shown to be innocent (which is not in any way a straightforward matter). This paper reports research which focused on the narratives of male school teachers and of members of their families, their friends and colleagues, who have been accused of sexual misconduct with female students which they say they did not commit and of which they have eventually been cleared or the case has been dismissed (Sikes and Piper, 2010). The narratives of our informants evoked and made real the lived consequences of policies and showed the damage that could be done to individuals in a way that no statistics are ever likely to be able to do (see Richardson, 2000; Smith, Auto/ Biography, 10(1), 131-121, 2002).

Respondents described their efforts to publicize the civil union or display the certificate in their homes. Other couples wrote about why the civil union was less important than their commitment ceremony, did not reflect the longevity of their relationship, or were not recognized by family members.

Carers reported considerable skill in negotiating placements and an awareness of the relatively tenuous position that they held within foster care systems.

Yet despite these challenges, lesbian and gay carers spoke in general of the unique and important skills they bring to care provision.

Spaces also conferred sexual privacy and comfort for women, driving sexual desire and encouraging, as well as discouraging, contraception and condom use in individual and complex ways.

Using a developmental narrative approach, 10 adoptive gay fathers (5 couples) participated in multiple open-ended interviews (both individually and as couples). Data were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings from this study indicate that fathering was a catalyst for participants' crafting new definitions of homosexual masculinity that emphasized relational and generative aspects of self. Specifically, fathering catapulted participants into a second coming-out process that helped them shed more layers of internalized oppression and redefine homosexual masculinity using fewer external referents such as personal attractiveness or an active social life. Participants also shifted their sense of membership in the gay community, partly because, for most parents, their community of reference became other parents of young children, but partly in response to their perception that the gay community regarded their focus on fathering ambivalently and with mixed support. Ultimately, the meaning that participants ascribed to their fathering role dramatically changed how they understood and enacted their homosexual masculinity. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adoption; Adoptive gay fathers; Gay adoption; Gay men; Homosexual masculinity; Masculinity",,"Armesto, J.

The ATF measure was used to investigate how children born to lesbian mothers via donor insemination (DI) described the composition of their family. Data were gathered from 17 children (age 4 to 11 years old) from 15 lesbian-led households on inclusion of family members on the ATF and the Kinetic Family Drawing Test (KFDT) (Burns & Kaufman, 1971). Also, data on children's inclusion of family members on the ATF were compared with family composition as described by adult family members in a prior interview. Child and adult family members tended to concur on who was in their family, depicting a core unit surrounded by a wider family network that included non-biological and biological kin. In comparison to the KFDT, the ATF enabled children to depict a greater number of family members in a wider variety of non-traditional family relationships.

Findings include that for married fathers older age, a lower level of education, a Christian religious denomination, higher levels of religiosity, and a conservative political ideology were all factors in a more negative attitude toward gay and lesbian adoption. Factors leading to less tolerant attitudes of married mothers were non-White race, having only technical training or an associate's degree, a Christian religious denomination, a higher level of religiosity, and a conservative political ideology. Single mothers differed somewhat from married couples in that religious affiliation was not a factor, but non-white race, lower levels of education, stay-at-home/retired employment status, higher levels of religiosity, and a conservative political ideology were all identified as significant predictors of attitudes toward gay and lesbian adoption.

For many GLBT persons, foster parenting or adopting is not a second choice as it may be for heterosexual men and women, but rather their preference from the start. Furthermore, a growing body of research shows that GLBT persons make good parents and raise children who show patterns of positive adjustment comparable to those of heterosexual parents. As a result, it is apparent that GLBT persons represent an untapped resource of potential parents for some of the tens of thousands of children and youths who need permanent and loving families. Although GLBT persons may have been historically discouraged from fostering or adopting, changes in legislation and policy over the past 10 years in some states and nationally reflect a more open attitude to GLBT persons as parents. The home study process, central to the certification and licensing for foster/adoptive parents, is discussed in detail in this article.

His theory suggests that adults enter into marriages and marriage-like relationships with a basic level of differentiation of self developed largely in the parental home and this level of differentiation affects relationship quality. However, there has been limited research on these propositions. Therefore, we examine these ideas by hypothesizing that (a) a complex relationship exists between family-of-origin variables as they influence adult romantic relationship quality, (b) differentiation from negative family-of-origin processes is one means whereby the past carries forward into the present, (c) there is a actor-partner effect of differentiation of self on each partner's relationship quality, and (d) that gender differences are expected. We tested an SEM model with data from the RELATionship Evaluation (RELATE) (N = 1,839 couples). Results support the hypotheses and suggest the usefulness of Bowen's theory for understanding how family-of-origin processes from both partners carry forward via differentiation of self into adult relationship quality.

Theory of social systems is employed as basic methodology.Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss complexity approaches of management theory, by focusing on their capacity to use efficiently contingence in organizations. As a theoretical framework the theory of social systems (Luhmann) is used, where a difference is made between complexity reduction and condensation. Complexity reduction is related to certain functional needs to control a hierarchical system. Complexity condensation redesigns communicative structures towards participative norm development, offering discursive connectivity, and decision making in networks. It is described how heterogeneous cultures in organizations have the chance to be successful by focusing their functional needs to include, to orient, and to motivate.Findings - The chosen research reconstructs management approaches to focus on functional imperatives of organizational systems as well as the development of functional equivalents. The logic figure of functional equivalents describes alternatives of exclusive organizational cultures. Heterogeneity in organizations is based on the redesign of communicative procedures, structures and cultures.Research limitations/implications - The aim of the paper is diversity theory development. It offers heuristic moments which might be useful in empirical research, too. Following the suggestion homogeneity is just an outcome of certain organizational decisions to deal with contingency and complexity, it might offer practical relevance by testing the capacity to change communication and interaction patterns. The culture-function matrix also might offer an opportunity to discuss the paradigms of organizational development towards more diversity.Practical implications - There might be the possibility to enhance conditions of observing organizations, but the practical implications might be rather limited.Originality/value - Using theory of social systems (Luhmann) as theory which focuses complexity traits is rather undeveloped. It could offer insights in the capacity to deal with contingency, and the attempts to suppress it. Complexity in social systems could offer a prerequisite to support the interdisciplinary research in diversity studies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Functional management; Heterogeneity in organizations; Managing diversity; Organizational culture; Theory of social systems",,"Koall, I.; Centre of Continuing Education, University of WuppertalGermany",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the measures taken to eliminate gender discrimination in employment since the American-led invasion in 2001.Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a literature review with potential to inform policy change to improve the employment situation of rural Afghan women. Although there is paucity of data on many facets of Afghan society, this paper synthesises available information regarding measures to improve employment for Afghan women and discusses factors that should be considered in future employment policies.Findings - Thispaper establishes thatmany rural Afghanwomen today experience cultural and religious barriers to employment. The paper argues that much as there have been significant improvements in the employment situation ofAfghanwomen living in cities since the US-led invasion, rural Afghanwomen still suffer from inequality in employment. In addition, the paper finds that the barriers to employment opportunities confronting rural Afghan women today stem from existing cultural and religious practices.Practical implications - The current Afghan Government and international community should pursue policies that would terminate the cultural and religious practices that violate Afghan women's employment rights.Originality/value - The most valuable part of this paper is the new insight into gender discrimination in employment in the run up to the ten-year anniversary of the ousting of the repressive Taliban regime.

Enslaved women's reproductive capabilities were pivotal for slavery and the plantation economy's survival once legal supplies from Africa were discontinued. © 2011 Journal of Women's History.",,,"Turner, S.",,"Johns Hopkins University Press",10427961,,,22145181,"English","J.

The regime's new abortion policy did not result in an end to the condemnation of abortion in official discourse. The government instead launched an extensive campaign against abortion. Why did authorities bother legalizing the procedure if they still disapproved of it so strongly? Using archival sources, public health materials, and medical as well as popular journals to investigate the antiabortion campaign, this article argues that the Soviet government sought to regulate gender and sexuality through medical intervention and health ""education"" rather than prohibition and force in the post-Stalin era. It also explores how the antiabortion public health campaign produced ""knowledge"" not only about the procedure and its effects, but also about gender and sexuality, subjecting both women and men to new pressures and regulatory norms. © 2011 Journal of Women's History.",,,"Randall, A.E.",,"Johns Hopkins University Press",10427961,,,22145180,"English","J.

In both governmental structure and internal social interaction, these communities of women constructed a system that simultaneously mandated deference, participation, hierarchy, and equality, balancing these elements despite tensions and apparent contradictions. The tensions surrounding the two-tier system that assigned lay sisters an inferior status boiled over in the climate of late-nineteenth-century America and, in response to lay sisters' protests, communities modified their rules, creating a new equilibrium. The dynamic systems of self-governance created by women religious exemplify the potential for empowerment, authority, and social mobility offered to nineteenth-century women by religious life, as well as the ways these possibilities and their potentially radical societal implications were constrained by a language and culture that mandated submission and obedience. © 2011 Journal of Women's History.",,,"Adelman, S.M.",,"Johns Hopkins University Press",10427961,,,,"English","J.

It argues that the shortage exists because it was only when they entered their first marriage that Tuscan women were viewed as complete, gendered beings by their families, government officials, and society. Before marriage, a woman's place within the household, her gender, and even her existence were liminal, at least in Tuscan documents. The result is that the ratio of men to women is more balanced for that portion of the population past the age of marriage for women. Shifting the analysis from infants and men, where it has traditionally lain, to young adult women explains the gender imbalance in the documentation and provides a deeper understanding of the ways that gender, adulthood, and identity intersected in premodern Europe.",,,"Bender, T.",,"Johns Hopkins University Press",10427961,,,22250314,"English","J.

Evidence of this arrangement demonstrates that single women in some places had options outside of marriage and the convent. The contracts filed by the women also reveal the extent to which this arrangement went beyond considerations of property to express both affection and loyalty. Available to siblings as well as to pairs of unrelated women, this union is likely not the equivalent of same-sex marriage.

These concerns about sexuality in the 1920s were recycled and amplified in the late 1940s and early 1950s when salesclerks again came under scrutiny during debates over citizenship and ethnicity.

Despite the profound moral and social significance of work-life balance (WLB), economistic 'business case' arguments claiming the benefit of WLB provision for firms' organisational performance continue to dominate the neoliberal policy agenda. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support the WLB business case. At the same time, conventional business case analyses sideline social equity concerns of workers and their families, and in their focus on revealed output measures of firm performance, say little about the underlying determinants of firms' competitive performance in the New Economy. In response, this article presents new qualitative evidence from Dublin's high-tech regional economy to develop an alternative socioeconomic analysis focused on: (i) gendered experiences of work-life conflict in the Irish IT industry; (ii) the arrangements that different groups of IT workers and their families find most useful in ameliorating those work-life conflicts; and (iii) the mechanisms through which workers' use of those preferred WLB arrangements helps foster and support routine learning and innovation processes within knowledgeintensive firms. As such, the article responds to earlier calls by WLB commentators to develop a 'dual agenda' that moves beyond either/or thinking to consider both business and social imperatives in pursuit of optimal work-life balance outcomes. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Celtic tiger; Innovation; Learning; New economy; Work-life balance",,"James, A.; Queen Mary University of London, School of Geography, Mile End, London, E1 4NS, United Kingdom; email: a.james@qmul.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052595701

While parenting is distinct from issues of partnering they are clearly related, not least in the ways that such policies themselves materialise families, offering new possibilities for societal recognition, legal recourse and access to welfare services. The issue of economics is significant, resourcing - or denying - various possibilities; class and sexuality also intersect in the construction of 'normal', 'ordinary' citizens now ready for inclusion. Many interviewees experienced this shifting terrain ambivalently, though a consequential classing of this figures in the erosion or consolidation of 'worth', 'normality' and 'entitlement', through which claims are made, families are (un)done and citizens are materialised. Both working-class and middle-class interviewees expressed varied uncertainties but the material and subjective 'costs', rather than benefits, of civic acceptance work to disadvantage working-class parents. The advantages of middle-class parents are re-constituted and re-embedded in changing legal contexts. The classing of sexual citizenship has potential implications across different international contexts, where public policies materialise parenting, spatially situating and legally producing the 'costs' and benefits of civic acceptance. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Civil partnerships; Class; Lesbian and gay parents; Sexual citizenship",,"Taylor, Y.; School of Geography, Politics and Sociology, 5th Floor Claremont Bridge Building, Newcastle University NE1 7RU, United States; email: taylor@newcastle.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052605610

Its key initiative - a series of 'New Deals' for the unemployed - is a supply-side active labour market policy that has been combined with important changes to the tax and benefit system to try and engage the unemployed in employment. In this, the need to give support to individuals to partake in work is emphasised. Yet there is little consideration of how the re-regulation of labour markets through welfare-to-work is contingent upon gender and class relations which condition the levels of access that (working-class) women and men have to employment. This article explores gender issues across Britain's outgoing Labour government's New Deal initiative using a local case study to consider how the institutionalisation of welfare-to-work at the local level constrains, rather than enables, improvements to women's quality of life. In constraining the potential of local projects to offer working-class women access to the labour market through programmes that create a genuine 'work-life' balance (as opposed to seeking the advancement of a market rationale), institutional restructuring around the New Deals is found to increase the pressures on women to be 'work-ready'. With greater numbers of women facing the challenges of unemployment in the current recession, the framework of contemporary policy does not effectively tackle the acute difficulties that 'working-class' women face in accessing paid work and consequently legitimates the gendered effects of (un)employment. In this context, attention to the gendering of governmental techniques associated with welfare-to-work is argued to be of ever increasing importance. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Employment; Gender; Institutional restructuring; Recession; UK; Welfare-to-work",,"Macleavy, J.; Uni versity of Bristol, School of Geographical Sciences, Bristol, United Kingdom; email: julie.macleavy@bristol.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052562516

As a collection, the articles emphasise the complexity of trying to define what work-life balance means to different groups of men and women in three locales (Bristol, West London and Dublin), highlighting that trying to attribute meaning to this concept is at the very least problematic. They do, however, paint a picture of persistent gendered inequality. Within the context of neo-liberal economic policy 'encouraging' women to take up paid work and training, it is still women rather than men who continue to be responsible for the tasks of social reproduction. The concept of work-life balance ignores the often blurred and ultimately socially constructed nature of what counts as work and what does not and tends to mask the large amount of reproductive work performed by women in the private sphere. Moreover, the research presented here makes clear that contours of power and powerful relations run through the conceptualisation of work-life balance as well as its practice and promotion by government, organisations and individuals. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Paid work; Power; Quality of life; Social reproduction; Work-life balance",,"Smith, F.; Centre for Human Geography, Brunel University, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, United Kingdom; email: fiona.smith@brunel.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052572950

Korea's democratization movement was at its peak in the mid-1980s and confronted the military regime and eventually brought it down. This paper examines the Korean women's movement and military prostitution in the U.S. camp town (hereafter the kijich'on movement) during the democratic transition (the 1980s-1990s). It also looks at the ongoing negotiations that took place among those who represented imperialism, nationalism, Christianity, and gender politics. Within the broader social movement frame of ""minju"" (i.e., people-centered democracy) politics, women activists generally remained marginalized despite their active participation. In this milieu, some Christian women and student movement activists came together to address the military prostitution issue (kijich'on) and gradually began to prioritize women's issues with respect to antiAmericanism and realizing military prostitutes' rights as human rights. Further, exploring how the women's organizations of the kijich'on movement, such as Durebang (My Sister's Place) and Saeumto (Sprouting Land), negotiated the changing political environment, religious beliefs, and national sentiments, this study discusses the tensions between nation and gender, as well as Korean nationalism and feminism. By responding to Korean androcentric politics, the movement's direction and activism changed and developed ""feminist consciousness,"" which then led to the growth of the anti-prostitution movement and pursuit of a more comprehensive women's coalition. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Anti-Americanism; Christianity; Feminism; Gendered nationalism; Korean women's movement; U.S. Military prostitution",,"Lee, N.-Y.",,"Ewha Womans Unversity",12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

Although quantitative indicators measuring women's status and gender inequality have been used worldwide and produced by various international organizations, they offer somewhat incomplete stories about the nature of socioeconomic disparities. Crossnational comparisons among East and South Asian countries have illustrated some of the similarities and differences among countries in Asia, which also show inconsistent or sometimes contradictory implications. These aspects raise methodological issues regarding the multifaceted and complex nature of women's status and gender inequality. We propose alternative dimensions to make up for the drawbacks in current quantitative indicators. Violence against women illustrates women's status in the private sphere and broader society in general. Further, the fact that women are more vulnerable to natural disasters than men should also be considered in assessing the damage from such events. Thus, given the aims of gender equality, national socio-institutional mechanisms for ensuring it need to be taken into account. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Asian women; Gender inequality; Gender-related index; Violence against women; Vulnerability; Women's status",,"Lee, J.K.",,"Ewha Womans Unversity",12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

This has led to considerable romanticization of what matriliny meant for women in everyday life. In focusing on a caste called the Thiyyas, who have a history of matrilineal descent and inheritance, the paper explores the way the norm of virilocality is coupled with the idea of the 'providing husband.' I consider the idea of the 'providing' husband as both central to the image of a normative conjugality among the Thiyyas and also as an idea that has characterized legislative changes in matriliny and marriage since the late nineteenth century. Further, I argue that the idea of the 'providing husband' and post-marriage virilocal residence are coupled not only with a strong sense of a dependent wife but a husband's unequivocal authority. However, what marks out this context is that women inherit property and have a right to return to their natal homes. These practices in turn enable considerable flexibility in residence in everyday life. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Kerala; Marriage; Matrilineal kinship; Property rights; Residence; Thiyyas",,"Abraham, J.",,"Ewha Womans Unversity",12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

This question is ubiquitous and has been one of the major concerns in the study of autobiographical writings. It has been argued that such writings, though personal, are seen as a way of liberating women from the shackle of male oppression. Autobiography allows women to have a voice, and to have it heard too. In effect, women find agency in their writing, allowing them to be and feel like subjects. The development of critical theory such as postmodernism further complicates the relationship between writing and female subjectivity as it foregrounds the irrevocable fragmentation of the subject. Employing Lynne Pearce's feminist reading of Bakthin's dialogics as theoretical framework, this paper suggests an alternative reading to Zubaidah⋯ My Story, arguing that what critics of autobiography can do is to re-engage with and then re-evaluate the poetics of perception, foregrounding the urgency of reconstructing female reality. Hinging on my role as a reader, I argue that one way to re-engage and re-evaluate the constituents of the writer's subjectivity is to dialogically approach the text as it is within this reconstruction that her story is elevated from mere historical account to culturally relevant communication of the female self. © 2011 Asian Center for Women's Studies; Ewha Womans University Press.","Autobiography; Communication; Dialogics; Poetics of perception; The subject",,"Aziz, J.",,,12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

Three hundred and 23 college men were recruited from two public universities to respond to an online survey, which used (a) a demographic questionnaire, (b) the HBI-20, (c) the Male Role Norms Inventory-Revised, (d) the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory, (e) the Gender Role Conflict Scale, and (f) the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the HBI-20 suggested five factors. Evidence was found for the reliability and concurrent validity of the HBI-20.

We predicted that heterosexual men would show a reduction in performance and motivation when working on a feminine task under gay salience.

Gaard states that Western culture has its grounds in a fear or hatred not only of homosexuals and their sexual intercourse, but of eroticism in general. She names it erotophobia, and it is because of erotophobia that non-reproductive sexual acts are viewed as moral deviation or perversion. To show us how pervasive erotophobia is she analyzes the history of Christianity and the colonization of America to highlight the conections between different forms of oppression (of women, of queer sexualities, of non-white people, of nature). What characterizes a queer perspective in ecofeminism is exactly the attention to thinking those interconnections and a will to rethink and liberate the erotic as a form of power. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Erotophobia.; Heterossexism; Naturism; Queer ecofeminism",,"Gaard, G.C.; University of Wisconsin, River Falls, United States",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

This paper focuses on these suppressed dimensions through an examination of a Hiromi Ito's queer ecopoem ""Chitô [Tito],"" from the co-authored book Noro to Saniwa [Noro and Saniwa]. I give attention to sexuality, especially queerness, in inner nature and body. The paper positions Hiromi Ito as a queer ecopoet because, in ""Chitô,"" she problematizes the boundary between heterosexuality and homosexuality by implicitly questioning the 'naturalness' of pervasive heterosexuality, shows her uninhibitedly retained erotic significance of pre-Oedipal anality in her adult sexual explorations as well as a self-contained onanist utopia in her 'one-woman' SM relationship, and treats the men in the poem as being mere dismembered bodies and objectified sexual organs; moreover, her queerness finds another significant embodiment in her refusal to let herself fall prey to the pitfalls of fixed sexual identity or sexuality. In this sense, this paper sheds light on the forgotten dimensions of the outer nature/inner nature and the natural environment/body dichotomies in ""Chitô"": inner nature and body. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Heterosexuality/homosexuality; Hiromi ito; Outer nature/inner nature; Queer ecopoet/ecopoem; The natural environment/body",,"Morita, K.; Rikkyo UniversityJapan",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

In this text I seek to give positive value to the epistolary literature originating from a private exchange of letters, stressing that this kind of literary production can be as transgressive as the so-called ""great literature"", i.e. that literature that seeks to transpose the limits of language, since in this specific case we recreate ourselves, transgressing the limits of what we are in the intersubjective space of letter exchange and of friendship. Thus, I interpret the personal letters of the São Paulo plastic artist Anita Malfatti (1889), addressed to the modernist writer Mário de Andrade (1893-1945), as a form of ""minor literature"", in the sense given by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. This private kind of writing is connected to the construction of a selfsculpture, an ""art of oneself"", in the words of Michel Foucault. I therefore read the self writing in the letters of Malfatti as a counter hegemonic and political writing, for in the plot developed in her letters she produces an autonomous feminine subjectivity which resists subjectivities connected to the family, to the state, and to the church. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Epistolary writing; Feminine sjectivity; Friendship; Gender",,"Ionta, M.; Universidade Federal de ViçosaBrazil",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

Although the concepts that define such masculinities vary based on differences of culture, time and local identities, they established hierarchies between identity and difference. Still, it is possible to think about the recognition of diversity and the exploration of alternative possibilities of psychological and social ""contact zones"". That would occur with the sharing of experiences and of criticism as to the production of otherness consolidated by binary relations of power in social and political institutions, aiming to overcome those exclusionary practices in thought and in behavior. This sharing allows for a conversation among traditions that respond to the oppression generated in the process of the reproduction of Western masculinities. © 2010 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","International relations; Masculinities; Post-colonialism",,"de Jesus, D.S.V.; Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de JaneiroBrazil",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

This term designates the surrender that mothers or other members of the biological family make of their children to other people for their adoption. To account for the meanings currently associated to these practices, on one hand, we describe and analyze the process through which the surrender of children performed by public deed was suppressed by Argentine legislation. On the other hand, we focus on the analysis of legal adoption cases of children who were directly surrendered by their mothers and/or families of origin. Through this analysis, we examine the ways assumed by governmental intervention whenever the aim is to protect a population deemed ""vulnerable"" and to fight ""children trafficking"". This investigation leads to explore the dilemma represented by child adoption in a society engulfed by deep social inequities, and to meditate on which are the ""rights"" acknowledged to those women for whom the surrender of a child in adoption constitutes an option within a limited range of possibilities. © 2011 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Children adoption; Direct surrenders; Free choice; Inequities; State",,"Villalta, C.; Universidade de Buenos AiresArgentina",,,0104026X,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

It addresses the exclusion of women and their peculiar interests from deliberations aimed at constructing a post conflict state framework that resolves the contradictions that incite violent conflict and provides safeguards against recurrence. The paper argues that the failure of peace talks to deliberately incorporate women interests detracts from their potential to effectively confront the questions of post conflict rebuilding. It notes the increasing inclusion of women but argues that this does not amount to gender representation. This is because at the heart of the inclusion is the requirement of female participants to represent non-gendered interests of class, ethnicity, religion as the case may be. In the light of this, it is contended that to the extent that their claim to power derives from their social navigation of the structures of power through relationships with men, their representation can only reinforce the very basis of women's subordinate status. Going further, the paper challenges the argument for feminizing peace talks in Africa. It considers this as reverse chauvinism and calls instead for incorporation. In concluding, it is contended that peace talks need to be democratized and female representation placed within the broader context of social challenges. This approach will prevent the undue reification of gender-read women- interests with the consequence of heightening the 'sex wars' in ways that does not add value to democratic incorporation.","Conflict; Exclusion; Gender; Peace talks",,"Iwilade, A.; Department of International Relations, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Its main purpose is to assess the impact of GMCL on enhancing economical and social empowerment of women in order to better understand the potential of this particular type o initiative in promoting capacity building and local development. The findings show the need to see community enterprise programmes in a much more holistic light than is conventionally understood.

This novel is Mary's failure of individuation in the confrontation of her psychological and cultural parts, shaped by colonial experience. Lessing, by depicting her protagonist in a particular British colonial setting, artistically reveals that her identity is negotiated and constructed by the social and behavioral expectations, developed through her racial role as a white woman colonizer and her gender role as a woman colonized in a patriarchal narrative of the same setting. In this article, I will discuss how the cross-hatched intersection of gender, class, and race through their relationship to each other operates in Mary's failure of her female individuation. Mary's attempt in achieving her own sense of self in this process of individuation fails and dooms her to death because of the same sexual and ideological factors, rooted in her family and culture.","Colonialism; Doris lessing; Female individuation; Feminism; Grass is singing; Sexual politics",,"Aghazadeh, S.; Department of English Literature, University of MalayaMalaysia",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

This is marginal benefit incidence of public spending which is rarely determined. In this paper, we determine the extent to which an expansion in public education is effective in reducing gender gaps in enrollments and thus, poverty in Cameroon. Government subsidies directed towards higher education are poorly targeted and the poorest income groups receive less than the richest income groups and indeed favor those who are better off. Similarly, gender disparity in access to public schools is higher at the tertiary level and lowest at primary level. Further, contrary to earlier studies which found that primary education expansion mostly benefits the poor, the present paper found that increased subsidy to primary and secondary education is captured by the middle income groups and as such cannot be good as a program that can be directed (explicitly) at fighting poverty. The difference may come from the fact that their enrollment estimates lump together private and public schools enrollments. It is difficult to think of a policy at which private operators will want to expand on their schooling projects.","Cameroon; Education; Gender; Marginal benefit; Poverty",,"Johannes, T.A.; Faculty of Economics and Management, University of DschangCameroon",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

At the core of the issue are two major problems: pervasive poverty and legal exclusion. In turn, these two issues are closely connected since legal/judicial exclusion is a consequence of poverty. This paper aims to analyze the question of violence against women in Guatemala, to discuss women's limited political, legal and economic rights, as well as the policies pursued since the end of Guatemala's civil war to deal with the violence. The fact that crimes against women have not declined, but in fact are on the rise points to the ineffective nature of the existing polices, and the need to make a larger investment in antipoverty and other socioeconomic policies geared to increase women's economic self-sufficiency.","Conditional cash programs; Guatemala; Poverty; Violence against women (VAW)",,"Ogrodnik, C.; MS Public Policy and Management, Carnegie Mellon University, University of PittsburghUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

When college professors receive disclosures from their students they have to develop strategies on how to effectively handle the disclosure, how to manage the classroom environment and assignments knowing that a survivor is in the course, and how to effectively handle their own emotional impact that may result from the disclosure.

Political science research has mostly focused on how lower courts make their interpretations in light of Supreme Court precedents. This article examines how the federal courts have interpreted the Pregnancy Discrimination Act's (PDA) ""related medical conditions"" clause in the absence of legislative or Supreme Court guidance. Three primary claims have been litigated as conditions related to pregnancy that therefore require protection in the workplace-insurance coverage of prescription contraception, inclusion of infertility treatments under insurance, and the provision of time and privacy for breastfeeding. Besides the PDA's guarantee of formal equality in the workplace, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) also requires employers to make some accommodations for pregnant women. In all three policy areas the case law demonstrates a lack of consistency and the existence of conflict in the federal district courts, but the appellate courts are slowly beginning to provide some consistency within circuits. As the courts have considered the statutory protection for women extending beyond pregnancy, their responses have been ambivalent at best. It is only in the contraception cases that the door remains open for explicit PDA protection. The ADA may potentially protect women in terms of infertility coverage and breastfeeding; however, Supreme Court rulings requiring disabilities under the ADA to be permanent may have shut the door on the ADA's protection of any aspect of pregnancy. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Americans with disabilities act; Breastfeeding; Contraception; Infertility; Pregnancy discrimination act",,"Deardorff, M.

The introduction frames these otherwise diversely voiced essays by naming and defining a group of concepts from cultural theory and psychoanalysis that circulate among them: discourse, interpellation, resignification, intelligibility, nationalism, and the Third.

According to Brown (2005), our culture is also facing the death of modernitythe promise of a better future. The author ties these seemingly disparate ideas together by quantitatively and qualitatively analyzing representations of pregnancy in the media. As the author details, the focus on pregnancy may be an attempt to instill faith in a future that has been rendered uncanny and unknowable by the recent awareness of our potential annihilation.

These challenges are even more significant when one considers that the concept of 'social risk management,' around which the model of social protection on a global scale was articulated over the past decade, was initiated alongside the promise of transforming risk into a socio-political issue, or, in other words, a topic of planning, preven- tion, and management and no longer a factor related to uncertainty characteristic of an uncertain and interconnected world. The continuing social effects of similar crises at the end of the 1990s represent a call to reexamine the risk management focus of social protection. This article discusses the legacy of Holzmann and Jorgensen's seminal paper from 1999 on 'social risk management' in the face of newer ideas on social protection emphasizing the centrality of assets and rights. It presents three conceptual challenges: considering how to transform the structure and causes of poverty and exclusion; the failure of condi- tional cash transfer approaches to sustainably reduce poverty; and the lack of a national policy to guarantee families secure and protected lives.

This task will require, from the philosopher, heroic levels of fortitude and perseverance, which can only be reached in a state of divine inspiration. The journey through the so-called ""etymological section"" can then be understood as the deployment of the hermeneutic action, which is the only way that the relations of justice, as they appear in language, can be reconstituted.","Cratylus; Hermeneutics; Philosophy of Language in Classical Antiquity; Plato; Political Philosophy in Classical Antiquity",,"Flórez, P.

The project was designed around multiple case studies, and pedagogical workshops were used to collect information. Discourse analysis, as proposed by T. van Dijk, was used to analyze the data. The results of the study indicate that this group envisions the exercise of citizenship as a series of aesthetic experiences with a clear political intention, oriented to the improvement of public, economic, and social conditions for the affirmation of hip-hop culture. In addition, the results indicate that these expressions are motivated by a moral sense, which prompts the group to denounce social injustice, and the lack of recognition of human dignity and the contributions that their group can make to the building of a more democratic, diverse, and inclusive society.","Aesthetics and Citizenship; Citizenship; Exercise of Citizenship; Political and Moral Claims; Urban Cultures",,"Valerio, C.; Facultad de Ciencias de la Educación, Universidad de La SalleColombia; email: Cechavarria@unisalle.edu.co",,"Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia",0123885X,,,,"English; Portuguese; Spanish","Rev.

We then discuss works that opened up new paths and that, more or less explicitly, introduced the analytical tools and methodologies of cultural analysis, thus expanding the repertoire of historical actors and actions that made up the warp and woof of life during this period.

The election of Olaya Herrera, a Liberal, as president in 1930 gave hope to those who wanted a more secular country after almost fifty years of Conservative governments allied with the clergy. However, since the presidents of the Liberal Republic wanted to avoid a religious conflict, various anti-clerical militants forced a discussion about the ""religious question"" in the press and from their political offices. The Church hierarchy felt threatened and decided to organize a National Eucharistic Congress in August 1935 as a collective show of force. The leftist majority in the Bogotá municipal council sent the Congress a disrespectful telegram; their message, and the reaction to it by members of the clergy, solidified the opinions and fears on both extremes in the debate about the Church's role in Colombian society, pushing more moderate voices aside. The opposition became a caricature in the increasingly violent rhetoric and the two sides stopped listening to each other in an atmosphere of mutual fear and mistrust.","Anticlericalism; Catholic Church; Liberal Republic; The violence",,"Williford, T.

This dual articulation promotes greater associative density: the territorial networks have better knowledge of the specific policies implemented in their cities; and the sectoral networks, besides participating in all stages of policy implementation, can understand their impact at the national and local level.","Civil society; Deliberative democracy; Nongovernmental organizations; Social participation; Social welfare",,"Hevia, F.

Primary schools became common and they also developed a high school program; now all children attend state institutions from the age of two. For the last ten years graduates from the Guambiano agricultural high school have been attending the Universidad del Valle. Due to the low performance and high dropout rate among indigenous students of different ethnic groups, in 2005 we initiated various support programs, such as the University and Cultures project. The realization that their poor performance was rooted in problems of poor schooling, rather than a cultural clash as we had initially expected, led us investigate how schooling was conducted in two indigenous reserves. Cultural psychology prompted us to explore the political and educational context that gave birth to the new institutions in which these youngsters are being educated. It also encouraged us to investigate the impact of the introduction, through technological media, of cultural models that promote values and behavior in opposition to their ancestral culture.

Using data from the Labour Force Survey, an original analysis of the gendering of the UK knowledge economy is presented. It finds that the choice of definition of the knowledge economy makes a difference to its gender composition: the more centred on technology and fixed capital, the more masculine, the more centred on human capital, the more gender balanced.

It involves a new production paradigm and, therefore, a redefinition of how our societies function. In the political debate a direct linear causality has been established between the move towards the KBS and social cohesion. We discuss this assumption using the concrete example of gender equality. There are three processes at the very core of the paradigmatic change in the production system: new forms of knowledge (demand for ICT skills, but also social competences), a transformation in the type of products in demand (tertiarization of the economy), and new modes of regulation (new forms of work organization and new types of work). We discuss the main conclusions of the prolific debate that has recently taken place concerning the gender impact of these processes and present a statistical analysis of the gender dimension of the KBS resulting from them. This analysis demonstrates that progress in gender equality is not balanced. While it is important when accessing employment, it is much more limited as far as pay and childcare are concerned. Making headway in one of these dimensions of gender equality is not necessarily associated with progress in others. Secondly, this analysis shows that there is not necessarily a direct connection between a high educational level and gender equality. Finally, it shows that the role played by institutional factors is very significant, although it varies depending on the equality dimension considered. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Childcare; Equal pay; Gender equality; Knowledge-based society; Participation in the labour market","child care; employment; gender disparity; information and communication technology; knowledge; regulatory framework; statistical analysis","Caprile, M.; CIREM, Travessera de les Corts, 39-43, Lateral 2a, 08028 Barcelona, Spain; email: maria.caprile@cirem.org",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650391653

In this analysis I demonstrate how the market processes involved in the transition to the knowledge society entail opposing tendencies regarding gender inequalities. The European Union (EU) has brought into play a certain degree of convergence pressure by integrating relevant objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into the European Employment Strategy (EES) in order to pressure member states to develop its model of the knowledge society, which involves economic, employment and social progress. The main concern here is to identify the extent to which the EES and, in particular, the gender mainstreaming strategy is a tool to challenge the market forces underlying gender inequalities. It is argued that the EU's policy processes take as a given, and indeed promote the predominance of market forces in the construction of the knowledge society. Hence, the EU does not have a clear vision of what perpetuates gender inequalities and therefore what needs to be done to change them. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","European Employment Strategy; Gender equality; Gender mainstreaming; Knowledge society; Labour markets","employment; European Union; gender disparity; gender issue; knowledge; labor market; labor policy; Europe","Mósesdóttir, L.; University of Iceland, Regional Research CentreIceland; email: liljam@althingi.is",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650361688

Accordingly, in this research the authors examine the perspectives on bisexuality among team sport athletes. Interviewing 60 male soccer players from three strategically selected U.S. universities, the authors show that these athletes accept bisexuality as a legitimate and nonstigmatized sexual identity. The authors find that the athletes intellectualize an understanding of bisexuality in highly complex ways. The authors also highlight that though only a very small minority have engaged in same-sex sexual behaviors, at some level, most players recognize some degree of bisexuality in their own identities.

Using samples of gay identified and bisexually identified African American men, this study examined the relationship between HIV status and several variables: use of mental health services, levels of internalized homonegativity, levels of stigma associated with same-sex activity and disclosure about same sex activity to community and family. Compared to individuals without HIV, the African American HIV+ men who had sex with men in this study reported using more mental health services, having lower levels of internalized homonegativity and experiencing lower levels of stigma associated with same sex activity. Duration of HIV+ status was positively associated with disclosure about same-sex activity. This pattern of results was more pronounced for gay identified African American men than those who identified as bisexual. These findings highlight how disclosing one's HIV tatus can be associated with the coming-out process, but minority stress associated with a bisexual identity among African American men who have sex with men may minimize these potential benefits. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","African American; Bisexual; Black; Coming out; Disclosure; Gay; HIV",,"Zamboni, B.

Through a qualitative analysis of Stephanie's narrative (i.e., interview transcript), the author shows how her orientation, selfidentification as a bisexual woman and the process of becoming bisexual is supported by, yet departs from, the binary of heterosexual privilege of entitlement/bisexual privilege of choice. In the next section of the article, the author shows the ways in which Stephanie's claim of bi choice finds expression and yet destabilizes the binary of heterosexual/homosexual union. And the extent to which her spirituality is sexualized and her sexuality, spiritualized, redefines the binary of monogamous/open relationships and the family.

Although development agencies acknowledge the need for empowerment of women, the interests of change agencies are accommodated within the bounds of patriarchy, poverty, and paternalism.

Taiwan's policy on gender education emerged from the interaction of state, education, academic and non-academic feminist positions in reforms. This paper demonstrates - first, the importance of the socio-political contexts in which reform was proposed, and second, the actions of feminists in making best use of the opportunities thrown up by a confluence of social factors. The social, economic and political transformations of the 1980s saw the rise of a 'new' state both supposedly and in reality more responsive to the needs of non-profit organisations. In testing out relationships of partnership with the state, feminist activists saw the deregulation of education as an opportunity to get women's issues on the agenda. These reforms were catalysed by a series of social events bringing together supporters in a mood of celebration, protest or mourning specifically in response to particular events. The struggles, contentions, and negotiations that underlay the eventual approval of gender reform in education are illustrated. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Education reform; Educational policy; Gender equity; Taiwan; The state; The women's movement",,"Lee, S.-C.; Graduate Institute of Sociology of Education, Nanhua UniversityTaiwan; email: shuching928@googlemail.com",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650267987

We suggest that this model is useful for conceptualising how Turkish young men come to engage with physical education classes which can be considered as masculine communities of practice. In one Turkish secondary class, we found that football was the most valued practice, determining boundaries of participation and differentiating levels of participation in the learning community. Young men who were immersed and excelled in football took up 'full' learning trajectories and became accepted as 'fully masculine' while those who were uninterested or non-competitive in football took up marginalised learning trajectories. We suggest that these diverse learning trajectories came to reflect differentiated versions of masculinity. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Boys; Identities; Masculinities; Post-structural theory; Social class; Social theory; Sports and PE",,"Atencio, M.; Physical Education, Sport and Leisure Studies, The Moray House School of Education, The University of Edinburgh, St. Leonard's Land, Holyrood Road, Edinburgh EH8 8AQ, United Kingdom; email: matthew.atencio@education.ed.ac.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650288002

Subsequently, semi-structured interviews were held with 10 faculty members and 10 students.

Their cultural potency relies on conjugating a series of nostalgic American icons-the frontiersman, the militia, and the moral masculine citizen rebelling against tyranny-with contemporary themes of terrorism, identity theft, and civil rights to reactivate well-worn racist and gendered tropes of a vulnerable nation at risk from infectious aliens. As the name ""Minutemen"" implies, the groups rely on pop-historical narratives, remember some historical accounts, and dismember others in their quest to position the documented American citizen and national body politic as an aggrieved, authentic victim deserving of moral outrage, justice, and protection. A nativist feminism and a militarized masculinity are licensed as the ideal forms of this protectionism, acting out of a compassionate patriotism in the stead of a negligent state. As surrogates for the nation, the Minutemen attempt to invest the United States' past and present military actions with renewed virtue and success. Juxtaposed against the aged, white bodies of the Minutemen, these fantasies are haunted by their personal sense of gendered, professional, and cultural obsolescence-a vulnerability that traverses many white American resentments. As a cultural phenomenon, the Minutemen's sense of displacement reminds us that logics of morality, citizenship, and justice still depend on unmarked tropes of masculinity, whiteness, and individualism. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

In response to the public outcry against the violence, the Mexican government has deployed thousands of troops to Ciudad Juárez as part of a military strategy to secure the state against the cartels. In this essay, I argue that the politics over the meaning of the drug-related murders and femicide must be understood in relation to gendered violence and its use as a tool for securing the state. To that end, I examine the wars over the interpretation of death in northern Mexico through a feminist application of the concept of necropolitics as elaborated by the postcolonial scholar Achille Mbembe. I examine how the wars over the political meaning of death in relation both to femicide and to the events called ""drug violence"" unfold through a gendering of space, of violence, and of subjectivity. My objective is twofold: first, to demonstrate how the antifemicide movement illustrates the stakes for a democratic Mexican state and its citizens in a context where governing elites argue that the violence devastating Ciudad Juárez is a positive outcome of the government's war against organized crime; and second, to show how a politics of gender is central to this kind of necropolitics. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

This discourse, and the practice of solidarity activism with which it is in dialectical relation, signify promising new conversations and coalitions across difference in the transnational struggle against neoliberalism. However, anarchists' intentions of horizontal solidarity are troubled by the secularism of the anarchist tradition and by gendered definitions of power and politics. By way of an ethnographic analysis of a speaking tour of two Oaxacan indigenous activists organized by Montreal anarchists, I problematize each of these biases in turn and in their relation: the public/private divide as applied to religion and politics and to the domestic and the public is one and the same. I demonstrate the combination of these dichotomies in their marginalization of Magdalena during her speaking tour, as well as argue their historical articulation. By throwing into relief these correspondences, we may better understand the coimplication of neoliberalism, secularism, and gender, and we can better practice transnational feminist, as well as anarchist, solidarity. Beyond critiquing secularism and androcentrism as a failure to respect others' identity in anarchist solidarity movements, I suggest that this disenchantment tale contributes to what it describes, reducing vision for radical transformation. Likewise, gender-blind constructions of anarchoindigenism fail not only indigenous women but any anticolonial, anticapitalist movement. These interconnected insights become clearer when resistance movements and critical engagement are grounded in the experiences and analyses of indigenous women. As such, I offer this ethnography as a contribution toward a potential anarchaindigenism. © 2011 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.",,,"Lagalisse, E.

I examine literary, theatrical, documentary, and political representations of such naked protests in India, tracing how they draw from and reconstitute a wider cultural repertoire around women's nakedness that shapes their meaning and impact as critiques of patriarchal violence. I also consider the gendered logics through which each of them attempts to rescript the patriarchal terms underwriting the violence of the state. I argue that naked protest does deviate from the hegemonic norms of feminine shame that render women violable-yet in particular framings, the gesture also risks reinscribing a chivalrous ideal of masculinity in ways that should give feminists some pause. I conclude that the eventual success of naked protests as a viable mode of women's protest in India should be gauged not only in terms of their immediate reception and outcome but also in terms of the gendered scripts that they rewrite or reinforce. Moving away from a false dichotomy of protective or dominative masculinity implicit in some of these protests, I conclude that an ongoing deconstruction of the gender binary is integral to any feminist critique of violence. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

This article explores the emergence of transnational women's organizing efforts through a focus on a 2008 conference held in Juba, South Sudan, and hosted by the U.S.-based South Sudan Women's Empowerment Network (SSWEN). We describe the membership, mission, and goals of SSWEN, focusing on the challenges and opportunities in organizing as women across lines of class-, faith-, ethnic-regional-, and diaspora/home-based differences. We highlight the emphasis on spiritual notions of self-empowerment and feminized forms for activism in SSWEN's work, which are prioritized as a way to gain wider inclusion and recognition in society and to promote grassroots care for the community. We suggest that these emphases may be viewed as potentially liberatory, offering new opportunities for engagement in a deeply strained and politically fragile period. However, we also point to some of the limits of this approach, highlighting the ways in which an emphasis on the self and the spaces of the home and body divert responsibility from the state for postconflict reconstruction, care, and the dismantling of patriarchal systems. Our work seeks to move beyond conceptualizations of refugee women as politically disengaged in the nation-building process, instead highlighting the dynamic, overt, and yet contested organizing work of women to promote gender equality in the new South Sudan. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.

Participants with a history of CSA reported greater feminine self-discrepancy and endorsed more derogatory stereotypes about women than the comparison group. CSA was also linked to identifying with more feminine than masculine traits, but only among hospital employees. Results suggest that feminine identity is a meaningful construct to consider in the adjustment of CSA survivors. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Child sexual abuse; Femininity; Gender stereotypes; Gendered traits; Self-discrepancy",,"Krause, E.

The debates between proponents of these perspectives reflect different views of the potential for transforming gender relations from patriarchal to gender-equal. Yet, with respect to the overall prevalence of sex differences or similarities, the articles in the Special Issue show that neither feminist psychologists nor evolutionary psychologists have uniform positions. Questions about how and if women and men differ are still under negotiation in the articles in this Special Issue as well as in other research related to evolutionary and feminist psychology. Clearer conclusions would be fostered by standardized metrics for representing male-female comparisons, more varied research methods for assessing both psychological and biological processes, greater diversity in populations sampled, and more researcher openness to taking into account findings that challenge their theories. Theoretical growth also is needed, especially to develop and integrate the many individual feminism-influenced theories represented in this Special Issue. To this end, we propose an integrative evolutionary framework that recognizes human culture in both ultimate and proximal causes of female and male behavior. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Evolutionary psychology; Feminism; Gender; Sex differences and similarities",,"Eagly, A.

Most women blamed the wife for spousal aggression and recommended modifying her behavior to end it. Talking with female kin, who often advised tolerance, was the next most common reaction. When such tactics failed, a woman might ask male kin to intervene. Seeking the police or courts was considered shameful and might jeopardize a woman's marriage. Women enacted ""the good woman"" to preserve self-worth and oblige husbands or male kin to return protection.
