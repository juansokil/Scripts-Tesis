"1",2017,"Chinese Sociological Review","Institutional Compatibility and the Diffusion of “Best Practices”: Human Resource Management in Foreign-Invested Enterprises in China","We advance the literature on global diffusion, currently dominated by the world polity theory, by examining how the local institutional environment shapes the diffusion of global best practices. We argue that global best practices that are more compatible with the local institutional environment are more likely to be adopted by local actors, and that they also exert a greater positive impact on the adopters. In contrast to existing research that typically focuses on a single policy or structure, we collected original data on the diffusion of twenty-five human resource management best practices in foreign-invested enterprises in China. Our analysis shows considerable variation in the adoption level across practices, much of which is attributable to their different levels of compatibility with China's local institutional environment. Furthermore, we find that adopting more compatible practices indeed makes greater contribution to organizational performance. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84994784168","China"
"2",2005,"Holocaust and Genocide Studies","Common fate, different experience: Gender-specific aspects of the Armenian Genocide, 1915-1917","Violence against women was a central feature of the Armenian Genocide. Even before the mass killings, sexual humiliation was used to intimidate the Armenian community. After the murder of the Armenian leadership and men of military age, Ottoman authorities and Ittihadist supporters deported surviving Armenians from Anatolia into the Syrian desert. During this ethnic cleansing, rape, kidnapping, sex slavery, and forced re-marriage became de facto instruments of genocide. Eyewitness accounts and diplomatic reports shed light on the place of gender during genocidal persecution. Although scholarship has only recently begun to explore the issue, the Armenian Genocide offers opportunities for comparative gender studies.","2-s2.0-34247673230","K."
"3",2009,"International Journal of Gender and Entrepreneurship","Women entrepreneurs and venture capital: Managing the shadow negotiation","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to conceptually and empirically explore issues that explain why women entrepreneurs access only a small percentage of venture capital (VC) investment in the USA. Design/methodology/approach – The focus is on the situations women entrepreneurs face, and the strategies they adopt, to successfully fund their high-growth businesses with venture funding. Rather than looking for answers at the individual level (men v women), the authors focus on the construct of gender and the way that the socially constructed business practices and processes of access to capital may appear neutral and natural but, in fact, may deliver differential consequences to women and men. When entrepreneurs and capital providers are interacting around the terms and particulars of a business venture, they are also participating in a less obvious conversation – an interaction that is call the Shadow Negotiation. Through interviews with women who have been successful or are in the process of accessing VC for their businesses, patterns of women's awareness and strategic responses that illustrate this phenomenon are identified and their implications discussed. Findings – Women are actors with agency, taking control over situations that may be stacked against them. The analysis suggests that women entrepreneurs vary in the degree to which they identify the gendered landscape they are navigating, and the level of attention and care that management of this landscape demands. Originality/value – This study complements existing research, both theoretically and prescriptively. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-84993064640","United States"
"4",2004,"Personality and Individual Differences","Gender and personality influences in adolescent threat and challenge appraisals and depressive symptoms","This study aims to extend Gallagher (1990)'s research on students' personality traits of neuroticism (N) and extraversion (E) and their academic work appraisals using a diathesis-stress model of depression and an adolescent sample. An anonymous survey was conducted with 323 (120 male and 203 female) public secondary school students from Canberra, Australia. As expected, the study found that a higher level of N was associated with a greater amount of threat appraisal and a higher level of depressive symptoms, while a higher level of E was associated with a greater amount of challenge appraisal and a lower level of depressive symptoms. Regression analysis revealed N as the strongest predictor of depressive symptoms, followed by threat and challenge appraisals. The effect of gender on depressive symptoms disappeared when individuals' neuroticism was taken into account. Challenge appraisal was found to mediate the effect of E on depression, although threat appraisal did not mediate the effect of N on depressive symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-1542348676","Australia"
"5",2018,"Kurdish Studies","Reading and feeling gender in perpetrator graffiti and photography in Turkey","During the urban clashes between Kurdish militants and Turkish state forces in 2015-2016, young politicized social media users in Istanbul witnessed and experienced political violence through their engagement with violent words and images on social media, without being anywhere near the armed clashes. These were photographs of militarized nationalist performances of masculinized domination and sexist graffiti, produced by the Turkish Special Forces and circulated in the cyberspace. Based on an ethnographic study among young educated pro-Kurdish viewers and an ethnographically situated textual analysis of the graffiti, this article illustrates the ways images are perceived in the particular cultural and sociopolitical context. It argues that the gendered meanings that relate to the core of the gendered and ethnicized structural violence in Turkey, enhance the affective cybertouchof political violence. © Transnational Press London.","2-s2.0-85054952557","Slovenia"
"6",2019,"Sexualities","‘Boying’ the boy and ‘girling’ the girl: From affective interpellation to trans-emotionality","Once a body is named or interpellated as either ‘boy’ or ‘girl’, they will be expected to convey, communicate, relate and/or display a social gender that co-ordinates with the labelled sex. This is part of the process known as cis-gendering.1 I propose that emotions are also socialized during this process and are expected to be communicated and displayed to co-ordinate with the named social gender. This ensures that bodies remain uncontestably cis-gendered and heterosexual. The interpellation of emotion for feeling is thus a major part of the socialization process used to construct cis-gendered bodies. In comparison, those people who feel uncomfortable doing their named social gender because it is at odds with their labelled sex may claim a trans2 gender identity. This incorporates a wide range of self-identities including a gender-queer or non-binary3 identity (neutrois.me; transmediawatch.org). This article aims to explore how feelings are experienced in relation to a trans-gendered identity and what these mean for understanding and doing gender as ‘non-binary’. Using quotes from genderqueerconfession.com written by those who identify as members of a non-binary gendered community, I present a contemporary analysis of how gender is being re-interpreted and performed so that people may experience feelings they describe as either, both or neither ‘male’ or ‘female’. Findings show how gender becomes dis-orientated and takes up a liminal space where bodies and emotions are re-negotiated according to an emerging paradigm of trans-emotionality.4 No longer confined to a restrictive binary system, I argue that gender is an affectively embodied process that is constantly imagined, embodied, re-imagined and re-embodied. © The Author(s) 2018.","2-s2.0-85041357752","United Kingdom"
"7",2012,"Journal of Development Studies","Demographic dynamics in poor countries: Labour market conditions and gender inequalities","AbstractThis article analyses a Stackelberg differential game in which households' labour supply and fertility decisions are taken assuming husbands as leaders and wives as followers. The model solution yields the optimal number of children and labour supply of male and female. In equilibrium male and female labour supply increases with wage and decreases with children costs and time preference, and the optimal number of children increases with male wage and decreases with cost of children, husband's time preference, and female's wage and time preference. We test the model using Ghana Living Standard Survey Round 4 and find that women are more sensitive to changes in the labour market conditions than males, and better labour market opportunities for women may lead to a strong reduction in fertility. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84857348802","Brazil"
"8",2004,"Journal of Social Development in Africa","Gender and the media in Mauritius: A snapshot in perspective","The article examined the quantitative findings of a study on Gender and the Media in Mauritius, spanning a period of one month. Nine media outlets, representing approximately one-third of all media outlets, from print, radio and television, both public and privately-owned, were chosen for the study. The unit of the study were news items from newspapers (excluding advertisements, letters to the editor and supplements) and news bulletins. In all, 3003 news items were monitored to capture a specified set of data: the sources used in the item, who presented the item and who featured in the item. The results indicated that women's voices and views are grossly under-represented in the Mauritian media: women constitute only 17 per cent of news sources, a figure close to the global average of 18 per cent. What the public hears, sees and reads daily in the Mauritian media is written and reported primarily by men. Moreover, men's voices dominate in all hard news categories. In certain occupational categories, women's voices are virtually unheard.","2-s2.0-8144222573","Mauritius"

We first discuss the nature of meaning in music, and how it is constructed and construed. Examples of statements of gendering in the literature are cited, and the problems identified by writers who have questioned their validity are considered. We examine the concepts underlying terminology that has been used in inconsistent and contradictory ways. Three hypotheses are posed, and tested by means of two listening tasks. Results are presented that indicate that gendering is not inherent in musical structures, but is contributed to the perceptual event by the listener. © 2016 Sergeant and Himonides.","2-s2.0-84963682947","United Kingdom"
"10",2007,"Social Compass","Gender and religious orientation","Gender has been proven to be a substantial indicator of differences with respect to religiosity within Christianity. Females are always more frequently and intensively religious in comparison to males (Francis, 1997). The question of whether this holds for other religions remains unanswered. In this study we focus on university students in Catholic, Christian Orthodox and Muslim environments of Central Europe and in an American, predominantly Protestant environment. Religiosity is studied by differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity (Allport and Ross, 1967). If it were found that females are more social-extrinsic religious, one couldspeak of a sociological, instrumental and situational religiosity among females. On the contrary, one is closer to speaking of an immanent difference between the genders. Sociological (with the exception of socialization) and Freudian explanations are not confirmed. Psychological explanations, which include anxiety, authoritarianism and femininity (Bem,1981) are good at explaining the differences in religiosity between the genders. © 2007 Social Compass.","2-s2.0-34249294527","Slovenia"
"11",2011,"Sex Roles","When Male Norms Don't Fit: Do Traditional Attitudes of Female Colleagues Challenge Men in Non-traditional Occupations?","Our study examined whether traditional attitudes of female colleagues toward the male role negatively impact the psychological health of German men in non-traditional occupations and whether these relationships are mediated by social stressors at work. Traditional attitudes are presented as a threefold concept: Attitudes of female colleagues toward male anti-femininity, status, and toughness were measured. One hundred and thirteen men and 174 of their female colleagues from eastern parts of Germany and working in the healthcare and educational sectors completed hard-copy questionnaires. We used bootstrapped regression models to test for direct effects, controlling for autonomy, working hours, professional tenure, and sector of work. Bootstrapping strategies were also used for the analysis of indirect effects, even considering controls. The attitudes of female colleagues toward male anti-femininity were directly related to heightened depressive moods and lowered job satisfaction. For the attitudes of female colleagues toward male status, or male toughness we found no such direct relationships. Only indirect effects of female colleagues' attitudes toward male status, or male toughness on men's job satisfaction through social stressors were found. The study provides theoretical reasoning and empirical evidence for the importance of female colleagues' attitudes and interpersonal conflicts at work for German men in non-traditional occupations. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-82255162833","Germany"

"13",2016,"Journal of Sociology","Gender patterns in domestic labour among young adults in different living arrangements in Australia","Most research on gender divisions of housework focuses on couple and family households. This article extends this literature to examine gender differences in domestic labour across living arrangements, with particular focus on young adults. Using time-diary data from the nationally representative Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Time Use Survey (2006) it examines the amount and composition of domestic work performed by 20–34-year-olds (n = 889) living with parents, in a share household, alone, or in a couple, differentiating between routine and non-routine housework tasks, and between housework done for oneself only or for the household. It finds gender differences are strongest in couple households, but pertain across living arrangements, including share houses. Also, women’s domestic labour varies more by household characteristics than men’s. However, there is some evidence of non-conformity to gender stereotypes, with young men living in couple relationships contributing more time on activities for the household than young men in other households. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","2-s2.0-85000659052","Australia"
"14",2014,"Sex Roles","Expanding the Conceptualization of Workplace Violence: Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice","Workplace violence generally refers to interpersonal aggression, sexual harassment, bullying, and other forms of discrimination and oppression occurring within the confines of the paid workplace. Workplace violence affects women across the globe, resulting in a wide range of health, economic, and social problems. We advocate for broader, transdisciplinary, intersectional, and transnational conceptualizations of workplace violence in research, policy, and practice. Supported by findings from research conducted around the globe, we argue that workplace violence occurs not only within the context of women's paid employment in the formal workplace, but also within the contexts of other types of work in which women of all ages engage. An expanded, more inclusive conceptualization of women's workplaces in research, policy, and practice will promote broader recognition and acknowledgement of women's experiences of interpersonal violence in the contexts of their multiple work roles in unpaid and informal work, as well as the paid labor force. Incorporating intersectional, transnational, and transdisciplinary perspectives into research, policy, and practice related to workplace violence will expand understandings and interpretations of women's experiences of workplace violence across the lifespan; within their own multi-faceted cultural contexts and racial, ethnic, gender, and class identities; and will facilitate transnational, cross-cultural comparisons. Implementation of policies based on expanded conceptualizations of workplace violence can contribute to more effective education and prevention efforts, improved reporting procedures, and enhanced post-violence support services and treatment programs that meet the needs of women across a wider spectrum of workplace contexts. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84905592435","United States"
"15",2017,"Criminal Justice and Behavior","Developmental Patterns of Substance Use by Gender and Their Relation to Individual, Parental, and Peer Factors","The current study aims to explore developmental pathways of substance use by gender. The influences of various predictors of gendered trajectories of substance use are also assessed. We draw on data from five waves (age 14-18 years old) of Korean Youth Panel Survey (KYPS). Semiparametric group-based models are estimated to identify heterogeneity in substance use for males and females. Multinomial logistic regression analyses are conducted to examine the association between substance use and predictors. Four alcohol use and tobacco use trajectory groups were identified for males and females. A notable difference between genders is that, unlike females, male substance use trajectories do not show a decreasing pattern. Regarding predictors of trajectory group membership, results indicate mixed findings between males and females. © 2017, © 2017 International Association for Correctional and Forensic Psychology.","2-s2.0-85030326275","United States"
"16",2019,"Journal of Business Ethics","Male Versus Female: How the Gender of Apologizers Influences Consumer Forgiveness","In a corporate apology, the apologizer can be either a male or a female. How does the gender of the apologizer influence consumer forgiveness? We suggest that the relative effectiveness of corporate apologies made by males versus females depends on the nature of the corporate wrongdoing, namely whether the wrongdoing is related to performance or to value. Three experiments demonstrate that a male apologizer elicits more consumer forgiveness than a female apologizer for performance-related wrongdoings, while a female apologizer garners more forgiveness than a male apologizer for values-related wrongdoings. These effects are driven by consumers’ social perceptions of the different genders. Specifically, a female apologizer is perceived as warmer which offsets the perceived lack of warmth resulting from values-related corporate transgressions, while a male apologizer is perceived as more competent which compensates for the perceived lack of competence resulting from performance-related corporate transgressions. However, this effect is attenuated when consumers are the same gender (vs. the opposite gender) as the apologizer, and can be reversed when the apologizer is personally responsible for the wrongdoing. These findings offer novel insights on corporate apologies, gender-trait associations, and gender and forgiveness, while suggesting that companies must carefully consider the gender of the spokesperson in the wake of transgressions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-85009872804","China"
"17",2014,"Eating Behaviors","Associations among eating regulation and body mass index, weight, and body fat in college students: The moderating role of gender","This study investigated associations between eating regulation behaviors and body mass index (BMI), weight, and percent body fat in male and female students over the first two years of college. Subjects included 328 college students (215 females and 113 males). Height and weight (via standard techniques), body composition (via bioelectrical impedance analysis), and eating regulation behaviors (using the Regulation of Eating Behavior Scale) were conducted two to three times during both the freshman and sophomore years. Significant associations between eating regulation and BMI, weight, and/or percent body fat were shown mostly in females. In females, higher BMI, weight, and/or percent body fat at the end of the second year of college were found in those with low levels of autonomous, intrinsic motivation, and identified regulation, and high levels of amotivation, while lower BMI, weight, and/or percent body fat were associated with high levels of autonomous, intrinsic motivation, and identified regulation, and low levels of amotivation. The findings that specific eating behaviors in females during the first two years of college influence BMI, weight, and/or percent body fat may be useful for inclusion in university programs focused on college student health to help decrease the risk of obesity and disordered eating/eating disorders in female college students. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84899902533","United States"
"18",2014,"Australian Feminist Studies","The Australian National Council of Women: Its Relations with Government to 1975","This article describes the political style and practice of the Australian National Council of Women (ANCW) as it developed up to 1975. The historical significance of this lies in the fact that, during the first three quarters of the last century, the ANCW was effectively the peak body representing the great majority of women's groups in this country: groups whose activities focused on politics, religion, morality, health, education, the media, philanthropy and also peace, women's economic and political rights, child welfare and legal reform. The Council spoke on behalf of these constituents to all levels of government, and internationally through the International Council of Women. It generally did not represent women associated with trade unions and the Australian Labor Party, and the politically active women amongst its leaders tended to be members of the Liberal Party. The conduct of the Council avoided party politics; its leaders co-operated with trade unionists on issues of women's rights such as equal pay, and worked as willingly with Labor governments as with non-Labor ones. An assessment of the effectiveness of the Council's political activities is therefore an assessment of the political practice and achievements of mainstream Australian feminism before the advent of radical feminism in the 1970s. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84924037337","Australia"

A total of 120 children (60 males and 60 females) were selected purposively as a sample from middle-class families at Dhaka City. The children in the sample were stayed with their parents in different areas of Dhaka city. Children's self-dependence status was measured by a Likert Scale developed by Sinha (1968). The study used the original version of a questionnaire (Sinha, 1968) which found suitable and applicable for the use in Bangladeshi culture. The data were analyzed by a 2×2 factorial ANOVA. The results showed that no significant differences were observed between self-dependence of children's attitude in relation to gender. Although significant differences were observed between children's ordinal position of birth and self-dependence, no significant interaction was found between ordinal position of birth and gender.","2-s2.0-79956127856","Bangladesh"

Representation of Moroccan women in textbooks","The current study investigated the role of women as represented in preschool textbooks in Morocco. To this end, we have carried out a content analysis on the images representing female figures from 5 publishers (N = 2789 images, N = 95 books). The expectation that images of women would appear more prominently in domestic and leisure settings than in professional ones was generally supported by the results. Although most of the professions represented are those traditionally associated with women, greater equity between men and women can still be observed. Publishers are attempting to represent a society that is dynamic, despite certain deep-rooted customs and traditions. Textbooks contribute to the learning and perpetuation of stereotyped perceptions. The results imply that it is important that the roles of women are evolving more quickly towards modernisation/westernisation than those of Moroccan society is. The traditional influences still visible in these books are a reflection of the current situation of Moroccan society. © 2019","2-s2.0-85063794507","Spain"
"22",2015,"Gender and Education","More educated and more equal? A comparative analysis of female education and employment in Japan, China and India","This paper attempts to explore the connections between expanding female education and the participation of women in paid employment in Japan, China and India, three of Asia's largest economies. Analysis based on existing data and literature shows that despite the large expansion in educational access in these countries in the last half century, women have lacked egalitarian labour market opportunities. A combination of social discouragement and individual choice largely explains the withdrawal, non-participation or intermittent female presence in the labour force, notwithstanding increased educational access. In taking stock of these issues and debates across these countries, it is argued that the parallel experiences of women in these countries can be traced back to persistent gender norms which, amongst other things, imply the centrality of marriage and non-market unpaid labour for women. The paper argues that there is a need for gender-sensitive public policy in order for increased education to translate to labour market gains for women, leading to sustainable development outcomes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84948716497","United States"

"24",2016,"Meditari Accountancy Research","A gender agenda","Purpose-The paper aims to categorise the nature of the research undertaken in respect of gender and accounting to identify where research is undertaken and where there remains lacunae in the field. It seeks to offer prescriptions for more research in the field and for the consideration of a particular type of research that considers the gendered values that inform accounting. Design/methodology/approach-The approach taken is to provide an illustrative review of the literature in the area to demonstrate the streams of thought that are reflected in research in the field. The paper is therefore an argument for undertaking research in relation to gender more generally and more specifically pays attention to how the nature of accounting information is informed by gendered values. Findings-The argument is that the considerations of gender in accounting research are not providing the impetus for a change that will enrich accounting information and the decision-making processes that it informs. A different approach to accounting provides the possibility of providing more equitable opportunities for those working within the accounting profession, including women. Research limitations/implications-The paper argues the case for more research in this field. Social implications-The paper has implications for the situation of women working as accountants and for a broader diversity agenda. Originality/value-The paper seeks to re-emphasise an earlier paper (Broadbent, 1998) and re-energise the debates about the effects of gender in accounting.

"25",2017,"Women and Performance","Dermopolitics and the erotics of the Muslim body in pain","This article considers the role of sexuality in constructing racialized Muslim bodies within the contemporary global order. The author draws on Saidiya Hartman and Hortense Spillers’ theorizations of the flesh as the site of racial inscription. These theories have tackled how the body becomes raced through divergent sexual regulatory practices. Following their insights, the author argues that Muslim bodies are racialized through discourses of sexual vulnerability and the visual circulation of their bodies as flesh. The author focuses on performance pieces by Coco Fusco and <U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA> <U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA><U+25AA> in order to consider how race is “epidermalized” or experienced at the level of the skin, the body, and the flesh.

"27",2007,"Women and Health","Gender differences in clinical features of depressed outpatients: Preliminary evidence for subtyping of depression?","Background: Gender differences in depression are usually associated with prevalence, severity, and sometimes with specific syndromes or subtypes. However, a lack of differentiation exists between these factors. Aims: To disentangle depression severity and the specific items endorsed by men and women and thus explore the presence of gender-specific subtypes. Method: A group of 963 men and women treated for depression in the period 1993-2002 were matched on demographic characteristics. This resulted in a group of 353 men and 453 women (N = 806) on which all subsequent analyses were performed. Five instruments were used: the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), SCL-90 subscales for depression (DEP), anxiety (ANX) and somatic complaints (SOMC), and the Quality of Life Depression Scale (QLDS). Total scores and individual-item scores were compared for men and women using ANOVA. A cluster analysis was performed on the three SCL-90 subscales. The distribution of gender over the clusters was tested with Pearson Chi-square. Results: No gender differences were found in depression severity on the HAM-D. Women reported more symptoms on the DEP and the SOMC (p < 0.01). No gender differences were found on the QLDS. Of the SOMC items, 58% differentiated between men and women, whereas 31% of the DEP items and 30% of the ANX items detected gender differences. Using cluster analysis, a five-cluster solution was found with good face validity and reliability. Men and women were distributed differently over the five clusters such that women were overrepresented in those clusters in which the SOMC was high, while men were overrepresented in clusters in which SOMC was low (p < 0.01). Conclusions: It may be useful to delineate syndrome of somatic complaints in the context of depression that is more prevalent among women. © 2007 by The Haworth Press.

We examined differences between four groups of partner-violent men (borderline, antisocial, psychotic features, and nonpathological partner violent) and one group of nonpartner-violent men on five MMPI-2 subscales: Masculinity-Femininity, Gender Role-Feminine, Gender Role-Masculine, Ego Inflation, and Low Self-esteem. Results indicated that the borderline group reported the most consistent traditional feminine gender role orientation of all the groups, whereas the antisocial group reported the most consistent traditional masculine gender role orientation of all the groups.

"30",2014,"Eating Behaviors","Relationships between depression, gender, and unhealthy weight loss practices among overweight or obese college students","Introduction: Unhealthy weight loss practices are common among female college students. It is unknown if these practices are also most common among women in the subset of overweight or obese college students or if these practices are related to depression. We examined the relationship between gender, depression, and unhealthy weight loss practices among overweight or obese college students. Methods: Students (body mass index between 25.0 and 34.9kg/m2) from three Southern California universities (Mage=22years, SD=4; 70% women) were recruited from May 2011 to May 2012 for participation in a weight loss clinical trial (N=404). Logistic regressions were performed with baseline data to assess the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported unhealthy weight loss practices and gender and depression as measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression short form. Results: Twenty-nine percent of participants reported engaging in at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior (e.g., fasting, purging) over the last 30days, with no differences by gender. Self-report of at least one unhealthy weight loss behavior was associated with report of symptoms of depression (eB=1.14 [confidence interval, CI: 1.08-1.20]), adjusting for potential confounders. Interactions between gender and depression were not significant (eB=1.04 [CI: 0.93-1.16]). Conclusion: Among an overweight or obese sample of college students, unhealthy weight loss practices were equally common in both genders, and students with depressive symptomatology were at greatest risk. Obesity interventions targeting overweight or obese college students should educate both men and women about the dangers of unhealthy weight loss practices. In addition, screening for depression can help identify students who would benefit from additional supportive and coping strategies and resources. © 2014.","2-s2.0-84898889341","United States"

"32",2017,"Advances in Gender Research","Insights into Vietnamese culture of gender and factors hindering academic women's advancement to leadership positions","Purpose - This chapter explores the influences of Vietnamese culture coupled with national policies on gender equality on academic women's advancement into senior leadership positions. Methodology/approach - In-depth interviews with 20 mid-level women leaders and five top-level leaders were conducted at four different higher education institutions in the Mekong Delta (MD) in southern Vietnam. In addition, document analysis and participant observations contributed to the overall analysis, which allowed for the cross-check of data from multiple sources to investigate the participants' understanding, perception, conceptualization, and interpretation of their experiences of advancing in their careers. Findings - Findings show that there is a large gap between the policies and gender practices. Gender equality does not exist in reality, regardless of tremendous efforts from the Vietnamese government and policy makers to ensure it in all spheres of life. Additionally, patriarchal hierarchy remains dominant in the institutional administrative system, and Vietnamese Confucian ideology continues to confine and adversely affect both men's and women's perceptions of women's social roles, status, and forms of social participation. Nevertheless, academic women still develop professionally and find their own ways to advance to a few key leadership positions at their institutions. Research limitations - The sample of this study is limited to academic women in the MD in Vietnam. Future research should include more women and universities and colleges, from not only the southern part but also other regions of Vietnam. Further, international and comparative studies should be conducted to see differences in experiences of academic women from several Southeast Asian countries as they move up their career ladder. Originality/value - Because there have not been any empirical studies about women and leadership in academia in the MD, this study serves as a resource and foundation for improving gender policies and practices as well as future research on this topic and gender issues of colleges and universities in Vietnam. © Copyright 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85029892725","Viet Nam"

Again in 2009 a further one hundred and twenty-four (124) Jamaican adults were interviewed to determine their perceptions of the current gender stereotypes. The same was done in Barbados as a means of comparing the stereotypes of two English speaking Caribbean cultures with differing degrees of exposure to similar cultural influences. Equal numbers of male and female respondents were included in both studies. A 100-adjective list of male and female attributes was compiled using a 300-item list originally created by Cattell in 1943 and subsequently used and revised by various authors. The data were analysed using SPSS to arrive at the frequencies for each adjective. Responses of 65% or more were considered to be stereotypical of males and females within each culture. The results show that overall Jamaican men were seen as: coarse, reckless, aggressive, lazy, tough, arrogant, stern, disorderly, robust, rigid, autocratic, courageous, and hard-headed, Jamaican women were seen as: complaining, fussy, sexy, emotional, worrying, affectionate, sensitive, soft hearted and sophisticated. Barbadian men and women had overall lower stereotype scores than did Jamaicans. Barbadian men differed from Jamaican men in that they were seen as: reckless; disorderly; robust and tough man who is also show-off; arrogant; aggressive; hard-headed; courageous, adventurous; lazy; inventive and rigid, while Barbadian women were seen as: emotional; fussy; affectionate; complaining, sophisticated; sensitive; worrying; warm; fault-finding; sexy; touchy; sentimental and gentle. The popular music from both countries is used as a lens for understanding the cultures within which the respondents develop their gender stereotypes. The stereotype data is then compared with the music that is popular during the 10 years from the first study in Jamaica to the second pair of studies in Jamaica and Barbados. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-81055156157","Jamaica"

Yet the visual narratives move notions of intimacy beyond the frameworks of permanence, domesticity, and heteronormativity to interrogate how such framings intersect with concepts of good citizenship and market logics of privacy that foreclose the visibility of non-normative migrant socialities. What is more, by circulating “improper” images of migrant women's same-sex intimacies, the photography and film works mobilize alternative value economies through which the women's experiences are rendered legible without being made appropriable. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-85018755638","United States"

The game was played among preadolescent girls (and boys) with low-income and ethnically mixed backgrounds (Syrian, Kurdish, Chilean) in an elementary school setting in Sweden. In the analysis, I demonstrate that the girls who had acquired physical skills in throwing engaged in extended disputes about game outcomes to justify the status of moves and hold one another accountable. The same girls downplayed their skills and mitigated fouls in interaction with less skilled girls. In cross-sex games, the girls reorganized their participation to playfully challenge the boys' (physical) domination. The girls shifted behaviors as the configuration of players changed across game contexts to realize multiple, contradictory, and shifting (moral) stances (ranging from a """"morality of rights,"""" to a """"morality of responsibility"""" and a """"morality of play"""").

"56",2017,"Sex Roles","The Discrepancy Between How Women See Themselves and Feminists Predicts Identification with Feminism","Many women who accept the basic tenets of feminist ideology are reluctant to call themselves feminists, which is problematic because feminist self-identification is related to a variety of positive outcomes. The present research tests the idea that discrepancies between women’s self-view and feminist-view on the dimensions of competence and warmth are related to identification with feminism. This supposition is guided by the idea that a full understanding of why women have difficulty embracing feminism must take into account not only their view of feminists, but also whether women see themselves as different from feminists. Three online survey studies, which included 387, 288, and 116 adult U.S. women, demonstrate that perception of warmth identification with feminism was lower if women regard feminists as less warm than they see themselves. For perceptions of competence, the direction of this discrepancy was irrelevant: The more women see feminists as differently competent (i.e., higher or lower), the less they identify with feminists. Moreover, perceived discrepancy predicted identification with feminism even after controlling for women’s agreement with feminist values. Both endorsement of feminist values and perceived discrepancy are important in predicting identification with feminism and therefore practical interventions to maximize identification should target both of these components. For perceived discrepancy, interventions to reduce feminist-self discrepancies will likely be most effective if they target stereotypes of feminists as being cold. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-85010748029","Germany"

It draws on an analysis of the current research and policy in women's education in India and China. The paper highlights the limitations within education research, education policy, and schooling practice that are associated with the use of the gender and development paradigm. Some of these limitations include preoccupation with developmental goals, and identification of universal problems and solutions in education. The paper presents two main themes in education of women research - the developmental theme that focuses on returns to education and the feminist theme that focuses on gender bias. The developmental research in women's education evaluates the role of education in generating individual and social benefits in a cost-benefit framework. While, the evidence of gender bias in the structure, process, and outcomes of educating women are the feminist oriented themes in women's education. The paper concludes that the existing models of education in the developing societies aim to breakdown traditional social hierarchies and gender- based stratifications. However, their system-based approach and a lack of awareness about the individual contexts create new categories for grouping women in order to facilitate the research process rather than to change the women's lives. © Common Ground, Shweta Singh, All Rights Reserved.","2-s2.0-80051494783","United States"

However, the gate-keeping role of clinicians can put them at odds with the supportive position most caring professionals adopt. The RLE criteria used in a regional clinic were reviewed with a cohort of patients undergoing gender role transition. All nineteen patients were male to female trans women, with eighteen living in role all of the time and fourteen being fully aware of the RLE criteria. Eighteen found it useful to live in role full-time, with thirteen finding clinicians' knowledge of their RLE very useful. Five patients experienced problems with living in role, while the majority (n = 14) reported no/not many problems. Despite this, seventeen said they would live in role all of the time, even if their behaviour was not being assessed for progression to surgery. One hundred percent of responders thought that living in role was an important part of the assessment process for gender dysphoria. Although patients found living in role valuable and important, a number of suggestions were made for improvements to the RLE criteria used by the regional clinic. These included the ability to commence hormone therapy as soon as the RLE begins, and incorporating time spent living in role whilst on the waiting list with documented real life experience. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.","2-s2.0-68949092087","United Kingdom"

Previous work offers two distinctly opposing theories: the first, that descriptive representation may weaken accountability for substantive representation, if it leads female constituents to misperceive the incumbent's positions or give them a free pass on policy congruence; the second, that it may strengthen accountability, if it leads female constituents to pay greater attention to the incumbent and his or her record. Using survey data from three electoral cycles, I show that women are more likely to correctly identify their U.S. senators' policy records and weigh that record more heavily in their evaluations when they are represented by women.

In so doing, it aims to problematise assumptions with contemporary queer theory that 'normative' sexuality itself represents a stable status quo against which queer's celebration of the fluid and contingent can be unproblematically contrasted, by demonstrating the volatility of the sexual 'norm' itself. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-79958295412","Australia"

This article elaborates on this claim by arguing that the novel evinces a pervasive interest in bacteriology, and that Dixon sexualizes moments of airborne pathogenesis to condition her readership to recognize her commentary on syphilis. While writing about sexually transmitted disease under other auspices permits Dixon to broach a topic considered unfit for discussion by women, this article nevertheless contends that The Story of a Modern Woman is not simply a coded novel, wherein the circulation of tuberculosis implies nothing other than the virulence of syphilis. The novel's naturalistic settings, which include vitiated airspaces and filthy surfaces in and out of doors in urban London, recall environments deemed liable by nineteenth-century germ theory to harbor tuberculosis bacilli. These pathogenic surroundings critique the harmful conditions to which women were subjected by male-dominated institutions. In tuberculosis, Dixon finds a vehicle through which she can address the open secret of conjugal syphilis transmission, as well as stress threats common to women that necessitated New Woman political consciousness. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84856046251","United States"

However, the literature has conflicting evidence on mood-alcohol use associations. Understanding how individual differences affect mood-alcohol use associations remains an important area of study. Previous research has suggested that cognitive abilities may affect the relationship between mood and alcohol. The current ecological momentary study examined associations between daytime anxious and positive mood and both (a) the likelihood of alcohol use and (b) the intensity of use on drinking nights as a function of sustained attention, set shifting, and gender. Participants (n = 100) completed assessments of sustained attention and set shifting, then carried palmtop computers for 21 days, reporting mood and alcohol use up to 8 times per day. Results showed that positive mood was consistently associated with both likelihood and intensity of alcohol use, but the association between positive mood and alcohol outcomes was not affected by cognitive abilities.

"88",2019,"Feminist Theory","The ephemeral politics of feminist accompaniment networks in Mexico City","This article examines the tension in Hannah Arendt’s thought between the creativity of political action and the worldlessness of labour in light of fieldwork with feminist activists in Mexico City. Drawing from my ethnographic research, I explore how labour and action are knitted together in the feminist practice of accompanying women who seek safe abortion in the city. Bringing Arendt’s thought into dialogue with anthropologies of illness experience as well as the reflections of my interlocutors in the field, I shift from an approach to the situation of abortion as a decision-making event, to ask other questions about autonomy and dependency, freedom and necessity, mortality and political life. I argue that what is interesting about Arendt’s conceptualisation of the labouring body is not that she separates ‘bare life’ from the political sphere of ‘men’, but rather that it alerts us to the uncertain way our life is implicated with others. In conclusion, I argue that feminist accompaniment networks foster an ephemeral relation of care between activists and women in situations of abortion, one that invites us to re-imagine the temporality of political action and to ask, again, what it is to make a new world versus make this world livable. © The Author(s) 2018.","2-s2.0-85059011242","United States"

Using the only available cross-national data on access to Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) disaggregated by gender from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), I add to existing literature by examining factors associated with women’s unequal access to mobile phones across 51 countries. The largest of such samples, the ITU data demonstrates that the type and levels of gender inequality in mobile phone use are not consistent throughout countries. In fact, the distribution is quite variable, from incorporating a small-sample of nations where women have marginally higher access, to sub-samples close to parity, to a larger sub-sample where women are at a substantial disadvantage. Using Quantile Regression Methods to assess these variations, I test how major gender and international development theories inform inequality patterns. My findings suggest that women’s wellbeing, as measured by their access to modern contraception (i.e., reproductive autonomy), overwhelmingly promotes women’s relative access to mobile phones, regardless of preexisting levels of access. Other perspectives like the growth imperative and world polity theory show some staggered associations along the distribution that remain substantively inconclusive. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85059899945","United States"

A sample of 147 French male college students (Mage = 22.09 years-old, range = 18–30) completed a questionnaire assessing sociocultural influences, internalization of the lean/low body fat ideal and the muscular/athletic ideal, appearance comparison, body fat and muscularity dissatisfaction, muscularity enhancement behaviors, drive for thinness, and bulimic symptoms. The revised and final model was an adequate fit to the data, and included separate pathways for muscularity- and leanness-related concerns. This model shows that sociocultural pressures perceived from the media, family members, and peers were associated, through appearance comparison and internalization of the lean and muscular ideal, with body image concerns, disordered eating, and muscularity enhancement behaviors. Results reveal a strong and direct relationship between the internalization of the muscular/athletic ideal and muscularity enhancement behaviors. These findings contribute to the refinement of sociocultural models of the development of body image concerns and unhealthy body change behaviors including disordered eating among men, provide additional support for the usefulness of these models, and extend them to non-English speaking Western contexts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-85031100017","France"

This study investigates the determinants of support for women’s representation using the first electoral survey ever conducted in Oman, prior to the October 2015 Majlis al Shura elections. It considers cross-nationally recognized factors – gender ideology and religion – and tribalism, a factor heretofore largely unexplored. Confirming prior studies, citizens with traditional gender ideology are much less supportive of women’s representation. Developing a simultaneous equations model, we show that religiosity and tribalism shape gender ideology. Unlike in Western countries, education is unassociated with attitudes, and there is no generational shift towards equality; younger men are less supportive of women’s representation than are older men.

Methods: Psychiatrists who volunteered to participate in the study were randomly assigned to one of four video vignettes depicting an elderly patient with late-life depression. The vignettes differed only in terms of the race of the actor portraying the patient (white or African American) and gender. The study participants were 329 psychiatrists who attended the 2002 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. Results: Eighty-one percent of the psychiatrists assigned the elderly patient a diagnosis of major depression. Patients' race and gender was not associated with significant differences in the diagnoses of major depression, assessment of most patient characteristics, or recommendations for managing the disorder. However, psychiatrists' characteristics, particularly the location of the medical school at which the psychiatrist was trained (United States versus international), were significantly associated with a number of variables. Conclusions: Given standardized symptom pictures, psychiatrists are no less likely to diagnose or treat depression among African-American elderly patients than among other patients, which suggests that bias based simply on race is not a likely explanation for racial differences in diagnosis and treatments found in earlier clinical studies. The impact of psychiatrists' having trained at international medical schools on diagnosis, treatment, and judgment of several patient attributes may indicate the need for targeted educational initiatives for aging and cultural competency.","2-s2.0-20044386687","United States"

Changes may be made that affect only the individual subject and reflect behavior toward risk or behind a veil of ignorance that is thought to induce just behavior, or as an observer. On average women tend to reduce spreads across all conditions, treating others as they treat themselves and reducing risk and inequality to the same degree. Thus, their behavior, on average, follows a concave utility function whether applied to themselves or others. Men generally increase spreads in at least one tail of the distribution if only their pay is affected. However, men either abstain or reduce spreads to the degree others are involved and therefore reduce spreads most when acting as observers. Behavior of men cannot be described either by a concave utility function or by a function that makes no distinction between themselves and others. The gender differences conform to theories of sexual selection. ï¿½ 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84986260144","China"
"118",2013,"Educational Gerontology","Motivations and Perceived Benefits of Older Learners in a Public Continuing Education Program: Influence of Gender, Income, and Health","The demographic shift towards an older population combined with the increasing demand for self-reliance and community-based care for the elderly calls for a thorough examination of continuing education programs in local communities as a viable means of promoting successful and active aging. This study examined patterns of older adults' motivations for, and perceived benefits from, participating in a publicly funded local continuing education program in relationship with their gender, income, and self-perceived general health. Six hundred ninety-nine learners over 60 years old were surveyed. The study found both commonalities as well as distinct patterns of difference due to the influence of gender, income, and health. The results of the study provide validation and additional knowledge to buttress previous studies, while underscoring the necessity for further research on older adults' participation, motivations, and benefits in the intersection with sociodemographic and health factors. The findings of this study also reaffirmed the importance of maintaining and developing an affordable, accessible, and inclusive continuing education program in local communities for achieving successful and active aging for all. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84878428769","Canada"

Based on behavioral observations, adolescent-parent interactions were examined to determine the relation between adolescent-parent behavior, adolescents' perceptions of parental affect, and parents' perceptions of adolescent affect. Gender of adolescents, gender of parents, and adolescent gender by parent gender interaction effects were studied as was adolescents' age. Findings suggest that parent gender (i.e., mothers and fathers) and adolescent gender (i.e., boys and girls) are important considerations when studying affect in parent-adolescent relationships. Age-related differences were not evident. Results are discussed with an eye toward improving the assessment of parent-adolescent affect by using multiple methods of assessment such as direct behavioral observations and multiple informants on questionnaire measures. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-70350215672","United States"

Rather than debate the originality of her work, however, this article focuses on Hays’s writing procedure in order to illuminate the rhetorical affordances of biographical dictionaries in the long eighteenth century. Attention to the ways Hays remixed her sources reveals that she worked as a researcher (she located, assessed and used sources), a curator (she judiciously included, excluded and re-presented female worthies) and an editor (she is explicit about her attention to her style). She wrote within the genre domain to make a point about gendered power relations, modeling critical literacy for her readers. Hays sought to verify female achievement and implicitly encouraged her readers to do the same. In the eighteenth- and early-nineteenth centuries, feminist writers actively questioned standards of female excellence, turning to biography to represent, circulate and deconstruct female worthiness. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85031502581","United States"

We identify multiple dimensions in family policies, reflecting the extent to which legislation involves claim rights supporting mothers' paid work or supporting traditional homemaking. We use constellations of multidimensional policies in combination with multilevel analysis to examine effects on class selectivity of women into employment and glass ceilings with respect to women's access to top wages and managerial positions. Our results indicate that while major negative family policy effects for women with tertiary education are difficult to find in countries with well-developed policies supporting women's employment and work-family reconciliation, family policies clearly differ in the extent to which they improve opportunities for women without university education. © 2012 The Author.","2-s2.0-84874848375","Sweden"

This study took place as a first step in an AR4D project (Trans-SEC) that focussed on innovation testing with smallholder farmers in Central Tanzania. A participatory problem analysis aimed to develop understanding by researchers of the farmers’ crop production system and the local context. A participatory approach was employed to identify the main problems from the perspectives of farmers, giving attention to socio-economic and gender-related differences. Extracting from a larger participatory situation analysis, this paper describes the approach, methods and results of the problem analysis and also incorporates results from a household survey of the key problems faced by different smallholder farmers across four case study sites in the Morogoro and Dodoma regions of Tanzania. Results from the participatory sessions contextualised the quantitative results derived from the concurrent household survey. The paper highlights the critical problematic circumstances of low-income households, which are suffering most from inter-connected problems across their crop activity system. Results point to the problem of a lack of labour and time available to women, especially those heading households or of lower economic status. We argue from these results that intersecting, socially differentiated problem situations are an important consideration in defining relevant points of entry for AR4D projects and for shaping subsequent stages of research design to foster more inclusive, pro-poor processes. We conclude by outlining the benefits and challenges of conducting a participatory situation analysis as a first step in an AR4D project. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature and International Society for Plant Pathology.","2-s2.0-85047794444","Germany"

However, possible variation in sexual orientation health disparities by age and according to gender remains largely unexplored. Purpose: To examine physical health disparities between LGB and heterosexual individuals in a general population sample in Sweden, to explore potential age and gender differences in these disparities, and to test potential mechanisms underlying any observed disparities. Method: Between 2008 and 2013, 60,922 individuals (16–84 years of age) responded to nationwide population-based health surveys. In the sample, 430 (0.7 %) individuals self-identified as gay/lesbian and 757 (1.3 %) self-identified as bisexual. Logistic and negative binomial regression analyses were used to explore health disparities based on sexual orientation. Results: Overall, LGB individuals were more likely to report worse self-rated health as well as more physical health symptoms (e.g., pain, insomnia, dermatitis, tinnitus, intestinal problems) and conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure) compared to heterosexuals. However, these physical health disparities differed by age. Disparities were largest among adolescents and young adults and generally smallest in older age groups. Health behaviors and elevated reports of exposure to perceived discrimination, victimization, and threats of violence among sexual minorities partially explained the sexual orientation disparities in physical health. Conclusions: Age emerged as an important effect modifier of physical health disparities based on sexual orientation. Gender-specific findings suggest that sexual orientation disparities persist into adulthood for women but are gradually attenuated for older age groups; in contrast, for men, these disparities disappear starting with young adults. These results support a developmental model of minority stress and physical health among LGB individuals. © 2015, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-84957974581","United States"

The author's analyses indicate that parents welcome what they perceive as gender nonconformity among their young daughters, while their responses in relation to sons are more complex. Many parents across racial and class backgrounds accept or encourage some tendencies they consider atypical for boys. But this acceptance is balanced by efforts to approximate hegemonic ideals of masculinity. The author considers these patterns in the context of gender as an interactional accomplishment, demonstrating that parents are often consciously aware of their own role in accomplishing gender with and for their sons. Heterosexual fathers are especially likely to be motivated in that accomplishment work by their own personal endorsement of hegemonic masculinity, while heterosexual mothers and gay parents are more likely to be motivated by accountability to others in relation to those ideals. © 2006 Sociologists for Women in Society.","2-s2.0-33644630323","United States"

Low total testosterone (TT) concentrations in men have been suggested as a novel CVD risk factor, but its contribution to this gender gap is less well studied. Methods: We used data of 4152 individuals (2113 women and 2039 men) aged 20 to 79 years from the longitudinal population-based cohort Study of Health in Pomerania, Germany. Multivariable Poisson and Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the risk of incident cardiovascular morbidity (5-year examination follow-up), as well as all-cause and CVD mortality (10-year follow-up) between men and women. Additionally, the added risk attributable to low TT in men (<10th percentile) was assessed. Results: Compared with women, men were uniformly at higher risk of incident cardiovascular morbidity, including overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Men were also at increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.61-2.60) and 10-year CVD risk compared with women. In subgroup analyses, men with low TT showed the highest 10-year CVD and mortality risk compared with both men with higher TT and women. TT was also negatively associated with cardiovascular risk as defined by the Framingham risk score (P < 0.001), after multivariable adjustment. Conclusions: Analyzing a large population-based sample, we observed that men have a generally higher risk of incident cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, men with low TT concentrations were identified as high-risk individuals with regard to 10-year CVD and mortality risk. © 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.","2-s2.0-84870558923","Germany"

The sample derived from a four-wave longitudinal study in Anhui Province, China, based on which we constructed three time intervals (i.e. 2001-2003, 2003-2006 and 2006-2009) and stacked them. Our working sample included 10,181 observations from these three stacked intervals, representing 4,927 children with 1,170 elder parents. We used fixed-effects logistic regression to predict elders' favouritism among their children. Results show that those children who received more help with grandchild care from parents, who provided instrumental support to parents and whose spouses provided instrumental support to parents were more likely to be named the preferred care-givers. On average, parents favoured sons. For mothers, this favouritism was completely explained by proximity and intergenerational exchanges, and even reversed under certain circumstances. For fathers, this favouritism of sons was partially explained by proximity and intergenerational exchanges. Migrant children were less likely to be preferred care-givers. This effect was moderated by elder parents' help with caring for grandchildren. Particularly, mothers favoured daughters over sons if the above moderation effect was considered. We discuss these findings in the context of social changes including increased importance of daughters in elder parents' support networks and the large-scale rural to urban migration.

Brooks of South Carolina. It aims to subvert absolute ideas about regional distinctiveness in the antebellum United States in two ways. First, it identifies a national language of manhood through which leading men expressed and exacerbated the political divisions of the day. Second, it explores variations in elite conceptions of manliness and finds that they did not always follow sectional patterns. The caning controversy is noteworthy in this context, because it forced those in both sections of the country who understood manliness in terms of moderation and conciliation to the margins of the debate over slavery. Rather than divergent sectional ideologies of manhood, then, it was a national political culture in which emasculating rhetoric was pervasive, along with a shared commitment throughout the country to passionate, uncompromising forms of manliness, which did the most to promote militancy in the run-up to the Civil War. © The author 2007.

It acknowledges the declining proportions of male teachers world-wide and examination successes which indicate a reversal of educational disadvantage from female to male; as well as the recent evidence on the effects of the gender of teachers upon student success. An empirical contribution to the literature is offered, drawing from the gender-related findings from research on children's cosmologies in China and New Zealand with 346 boys and 340 girls (of whom 119 boys and 121 girls participated in the current study). The investigation focused on children's concepts of the motion and shape of the Earth through observational astronomy and gave children opportunities to express their ideas in several modalities. The in-depth interviews allowed children to share their meanings with gender differences becoming apparent (e.g. girls' superior ability to visually represent their cosmologies and boys' greater awareness of gravity). However, these differences were not universal across genders or cultures and marked similarities were apparent both in the content of children's responses and in their reasoning processes. By comparing boy/girl cosmological concept categories and by tracking their developmental trends by age, statistical evidence revealed the extent of the similarities within and across these diverse cultures. The findings reinforce those from the authors' knowledge restructuring and cultural mediation studies and provide support for the view that boys and girls have similar, holistic-rather-than-fragmented, cosmologies which have features in common across cultures and ethnic groups.","2-s2.0-35148874255","United Kingdom"

Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Evans and Boyte (1986) introduced the concept of 'free spaces' in their book: Free spaces: the sources of democratic change in America. Their goal was to highlight the invisible ways in which ordinary people organize themselves and democratize their communities. The authors in this special issue implicitly and explicitly use the concept of 'free spaces' to chronicle how lives unfold in contested spaces - not flat, seemingly 'neutral' spaces - but socially produced spaces, spaces imbued with racialized, gendered, and hetero-normative values and the hidden agenda of our society (Lefebvre, 1974; Hayden, 1995).

"143",2019,"International Feminist Journal of Politics","The adoption of women’s legislative caucuses worldwide","Recent decades have witnessed the rise, across a wide range of countries, of political institutions designed to promote gender equality and women’s political representation. Existing studies have shown how international diffusion processes have contributed to the adoption of two kinds of such institutions–gender mainstreaming and gender quotas. Mounting evidence suggests that institutional reforms within legislatures constitute the latest wave of gendered institutional reform. This article identifies and explains trends in the adoption of one kind of gender-focused parliamentary institution–women’s legislative caucuses (WLCs). We use a discrete time duration model to assess the effect of several factors on WLC establishment. While there is theoretical room to expect diffusion, structural and institutional variables to affect the likelihood of caucus adoption, we find the strongest empirical support for diffusion and institutional factors. A parliament’s likelihood of adopting a WLC rises when sub-regional peers have created WLCs, when women’s international non-governmental organizations are active in the country and when the country has implemented a gender quota. Understanding the factors that affect the adoption of gender-focused parliamentary institutions is critically important, we argue, since such bodies provide space to confront masculinized institutionalized rules and norms. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85060602048","United States"

Children reported their perceptions of adults’ beliefs and their own stereotypes about gender differences in academic abilities. Consistent with study hypotheses, fourth and sixth graders had a stronger tendency than eighth graders to favor their own gender group rather than report traditional stereotypes. On average, girls favored girls over boys in all three domains. Fourth grade boys favored boys in all three domains; middle school boys reported traditional verbal stereotypes and were on average egalitarian in beliefs about math and science. Children’s reports of their perceptions of adults’ stereotypes mirrored age and gender differences in their own stereotypes and were correlated with their own stereotype endorsement.

"146",2010,"Studies in Social Justice","The advocate's dilemma: Framing migrant rights in national settings","This article identifies and explores the dilemma of migrant advocacy in advanced industrial democracies, focusing specifically on the contemporary United States. On the one hand, universal norms such as human rights, which are theoretically well suited to advancing migrants' claims, may have little resonance within national settings. On the other hand, the debates around which immigration arguments typically turn, and the terrain on which advocates must fight, derive their values and assumptions from a nation-state framework that is self-limiting. The article analyzes the limits of human rights arguments, discusses the pitfalls of engaging in national policy debates, and details the challenges for advocates of advancing the cause of policy reform and shifting the frame for thinking about migration over the long term.","2-s2.0-79951794033","United States"
"147",2013,"Philosophical Topics","""Is an """"Islamic feminism"""" possible?: Gender politics in the contemporary Islamic Republic of Iran""","""In recent years, Islamic feminism has become a prevalent and controversial topic among scholars from Muslim countries and Western feminists. While respecting the efforts of Muslim activists, this paper argues that because Islamic perspective is inherently anti-pluralist, it is not conducive to feminism and even at odds with it. Since it is impossible to make any generalizations about Muslim countries, this paper focuses on the debate of Islam and feminism as it relates to Iran. Islamic laws that are the ground for constitutions in many Muslim countries treat men and women unequally. In countries with a theocracy, Islam becomes a political system where the power of the ruling elite, which are the clerics, becomes an important obstacle on the way of reforms. As a worldview, Islam provides a fixed identity of women and men that is irreconcilable with any liberating theory. The significance of this discussion lies in the potential of celebration of """"Islamic feminism"""" for reinforcing the fusion of religion and politics in a country such as Iran, which has a religious state.""","2-s2.0-84937425216","United States"

The study concentrates on the Fenigstein, Scheier and Buss's (1975) concept of private and public self-consciousness, distinguishing between two factors of private selfconsciousness: internal state awareness and self-reflectiveness, and similarly two factors of public self-consciousness: style consciousness and appearance consciousness. The purpose of the study is to verify the factor structure and the psychometric qualities of the Self-consciousness scale (SCS), examine the differences between private and public self-consciousness considering gender and age; and finally, confirm the association between self-consciousness and the Big Five model. Sample and setting. Research was realized on a sample of 298 participants, aged 20 to 70 years (227 females, 72 men). The sample was based on occasional selection. The 60-item Slovak version of NEO-FFI was used for measuring the personality dimensions. Statistical analysis. Exploratory analysis, the principal component analysis with direct oblimin rotation were used to examine the dimension structure of SCS. Cronbach's alfa was calculated to asses the internal consistency of the component scales. T-test was used to examine gender differences and ANOVA to examine age differences. To examine the relation between NEOFFI and scales of SCS the Pearson corelations and stepwise regression analysis were used. Results. Results supported the 4-factor solution of the scale with acceptable levels of internal consistency (a > 0,60). Differences in factors of private self-consciousness were found in two items compared to previous research; factors of public self confirmed clearly previous models. Factors of internal state awareness and appearance consciousness were significantly related to gender and age. Correlation analysis affirmed the significance of differentiation between two factors of private self-consciousness, as both were reversely associated with neuroticism, agreeableness and conscientiousness.","2-s2.0-84890914366","Slovakia"

So is the case with business, where the Internet has widened the horizon of promotion through advertising. Online advertising is a universe in itself, with different ways to present the promotional message of a company, each with a different level of effectiveness and impact on consumers. This necessitates the marketers to understand the attitude of consumers towards online advertisements in order to better target the advertisements to the right consumers in the right way. The paper attempted to fill the research gap in the area of online advertisements and thus explored the attitude of consumers towards online advertisements, the preference of content, attraction, and formats of online advertisements and the impact of online advertisements on consumers' purchase decisions. The results of the study revealed that there was no significant influence of gender on respondents' attitude towards online advertisements, and that respondents' preference of online advertisements reflects their price sensitivity and preference to animation.","2-s2.0-84919715793","India"

That is, we expect an interactive effect between gender and crying on our outcomes, an effect that will be mediated by perceived typicality.

This period was chosen to investigate the differential impact of the Israeli closure policy on Palestinian male and female workers. Although gross enrollment ratios for males and females reveal little to no difference in the primary, middle and tertiary levels of schooling, returns to schooling are significantly different. On average, females earned 14-15% less than males in 1999. The gender gap is narrowed during 2001 due to rising male unemployment in the Palestinian areas. Performing the regression for males and females separately, it is found that returns to schooling are larger for women (at least at the margin). The gap in returns to schooling was reduced in 2001; however, female returns to schooling as estimated by OLS suffer from selectivity bias which worsened during 2001. The work in Israel premium increased for women and decreased for men. Finally, Palestinian public sector employment parallels periods of restricted access to Israeli labor markets; its average wages are lower and years of schooling are higher relative to private sector employment. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – In<U+E4F8>depth interviews based on the initial stages of collaborative interactive action research (CIAR) are used within a case<U+E4F8>study approach. The interviews explored working practices, the assumptions underpinning them and their un/intended consequences. Findings – The main form of FWA used in the organization, four days a week, is double edged and complex in its effects. It supports mothers, but at a cost because of gendered assumptions. Despite a commitment to flexibility and “work<U+E4F8>life balance”, the gendered construction of the ideal worker and ideas of competence conflated with hegemonic masculinity, remain powerful.

Surveys were completed by 175 undergraduate female students at a women's college and a mixed-sex college located in the same U.S. Midwestern city. Results were opposite of what we predicted; women at the women's college were more likely to endorse larger body ideals, whereas women at the mixed-sex college were more likely to endorse thinner ideals. As predicted, there was a significant difference in scores between the upper college year students; lower college year students did not show significant differences in ideals, suggesting that although female students may enter college with similar body ideals, 4 years in a mixed-sex or single-sex setting can drastically alter how women think about body types. There were no differences between schools for self-objectification or physical appearance social comparison, and physical appearance social comparison did not correlate to body ideals. Taken together, this pattern of results suggests that social comparison does not influence body ideals, but rather, other characteristics of a single-sex and mixed-sex environment do.

Stakeholders disagree about the causes and problem definition of gender equality or pay lip service to the principle of gender equality, but fail to implement gender equality in practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine participatory modelling as an intervention method to support stakeholders in: reaching a shared problem definition and analysis of gender inequality; and identifying and implementing policies to tackle gender inequality. Design/methodology/approach-The authors apply participatory modelling in case studies on impediments to women's careers in two Dutch universities. Findings-This study shows that participatory modelling supported stakeholders' identification of the self-reinforcing feedback processes of masculinity of norms, visibility of women and networking of women and the interrelatedness between these processes. Causal loop diagrams visualise how the feedback processes are interrelated and can stabilise or reinforce themselves. Moreover, they allow for the identification of possible interventions. Research limitations/implications-Further testing of the causal loop diagrams by quantifying the stocks and the flows would validate the feedback processes and the estimated effects of possible interventions. Practical implications-The integration of the knowledge of researchers and stakeholders in a causal loop diagram supported learning about the issue of gender inequality, hereby contributing to transformative change on gender equality.

However, in the context of the #MeToo movement in Sweden, 1768 women published a call for an end to violence and sexual harassment in the military. We analyse this call as a public resistance effort against the military and find that #MeToo is: (i) challenging the norms of the hyper-masculine military organization, making resistance towards it visible; and (ii) resisting the practices of sexual harassment and lack of responsibility in the military organization. The military organization is questioned when it comes to norms and practices, but there are variations in whether the social order of the military is truly challenged. Still, the call highlights the fragmentation of this ‘last bastion of masculinity’. More research is needed on the erosion of the militarized norms and practices and the effects of the call. © 2019 The Authors.

She develops the gender power of women in the public sphere, saving both John Thornton's body and his career. Traced to the root, however, her salvation is propped up by the moral power of the conventional patriarchal society and the power of the drive for profit which is inherent in the nature of capital. Coupling the separation of social space with sexual politics, we can see the contradictions in Margaret's actions, which expose the ideological traps that are set before Victorian women charging toward the existing institutions. © Copyright by Foreign Literature Studies.

This article first analyzes the historical use and development of the scale and shows its built-in flexibility for individuals seeking tools for contemplating their sexual identities beyond the heterosexual-bisexual-homosexual identity triad. There is no place on the scale that is more """"normal"""" than another; all placements have equal socio-cultural weight. This article then examines 29 quizzes and online forums in different languages that use a scale or a version of it and their user comments. Many users who do not feel that the present-day sexual identity triad adequately represents their sexual self-perception discover affirmation and solidarity in finding a place on the scale in either a whole-number or decimal form. The elasticity of placement on the scale-one can perceive one's place on it differently at will over time-is particularly useful and applicable in a postmodern, online environment in which people are open to exploring sexual identities and to finding a precise labeling that fits them. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.""","2-s2.0-84863094164","United States"

The discussion is illustrated by using case study material from research with pre-school and pre-adolescent children in Indian educational settings. The article argues that whilst an ethnographic approach to understanding children can shed light upon how childhood as a structural classification of society, and in particular Indian society, is governed by its relationship with the adult world; attempts to provide explanations of childhood as a structural feature, necessitate an account of the age of children as a structural condition. Children's relationships with the adult world are quite different at different ages.

The concept of entangled relational spaces is the main analytical tool of this article. Seeking to overcome identity-based essentialisms, the article deconstructs gender identity and demonstrates how it can be articulated and interpreted in different relational spaces. It extends the argument that oppressions are produced by various social categories (intersectionality) by adding that a single social category may beget various forms of oppression and that heterogeneous gender asymmetries are produced and manifested across different relational spaces. Evidence deriving from predominantly indigenous sources authored by women enabled the discussion of gendered power asymmetries in economic, legal, and political spaces produced by corresponding relations. Economic and demographic crises, which the indigenous peoples of Siberia endured in the 1910s–1920s, reduced gendered power asymmetries in economic spaces making women less dependent on men. On women's initiative the shifts then spread to legal spaces and, with the support of the Bolshevik government, affected political spaces. These shifts were closely connected to the early Soviet attempts at dialog with indigenous people, decolonizing Siberia and liberating indigenous women, and gave way to instrumental policies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84930573989","Germany"

The present study considers the relationship between family loading and depression phenotype characteristics in a large community-based sample. Method: In a Dutch representative population sample of 7,076 individuals, lifetime diagnosis of depression was classified according to severity, course and age of onset. A family loading score of depression (FLSD) was computed by taking the proportion of the first-degree relatives for whom a history of depression was reported. Results: There was a strong association between FLSD and lifetime diagnosis of MDD. Severity, recurrence and early onset of depression were the specific phenotypic characteristics associated with familiality. The effects of FLSD and gender were independent. Conclusion: Associations between family history and risk for depression in the community confirm those reported from clinical-based studies using direct interviewing of relatives. A stronger degree of familiality is associated with specific phenotypic characteristics of depression.","2-s2.0-70449534083","Netherlands"

Alcohol use is associated with both gender-based violence and sexual risk behavior, but has not been examined as a correlate of both in a context of both high HIV risk and hazardous drinking. The purpose of this paper is to examine the association between recent abuse by a sex partner with alcohol and sexual risk behavior among female patrons of alcohol serving venues in South Africa. Specifically, the aim of this study is to determine whether sexual risk behaviors are associated with gender-based violence after controlling for levels of alcohol use. We surveyed 1,388 women attending informal drinking establishments in Cape Town, South Africa to assess recent history of gender-based violence, drinking, and sexual risk behaviors. Gender-based violence was associated with both drinking and sexual risk behaviors after controlling for demographics among the women. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that after controlling for alcohol use sexual risk behavior remained significantly associated with gender-based violence, particularly with meeting a new sex partner at the bar, recent STI diagnosis, and engaging in transactional sex, but not protected intercourse or number of partners. In South Africa where heavy drinking is prevalent women may be at particular risk of physical abuse from intimate partners as well as higher sexual risk. Interventions that aim to reduce gender-based violence and sexual risk behaviors must directly work to reduce drinking behavior. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-84877837174","South Africa"

OTC medications can be easily obtained in pharmacies for self-treatment, but using OTC medications is not always safe and beneficial for patients. The aims of this study were to examine the use patterns of OTC medications and assess patients’ perspectives regarding the use of OTC medications in Korean patients with chronic diseases. Patients and methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was carried out with Korean patients who visited the community pharmacy, located at the southern region of South Korea, during September 2015. Results: A total of 345 patients participated in this survey. Approximately 64% of Korean survey respondents reported that they had used OTC drugs. The most commonly used OTC medications were antipyretics, analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. The perception level of Korean consumers on adverse drug reactions and drug–drug interactions from OTC medications was relatively low. Although OTC package leaflets are a main source of information about OTC medications, Korean consumers’ level of reading OTC package leaflets was relatively low. Conclusion: Based on these results, this study can serve as a meaningful starting point for interventions of health care professionals regarding OTC medications in South Korea. In particular, pharmacists should inform their consumers of drug-related problems from OTC drugs during consultation with the consumers; however, information about OTC drugs should be tailored to consumer information needs with the consideration of his or her circumstance.

Gender quotas in politics, however, are thought to remain outside the normative scope of Community law, the dominant view being that candidature for elected public office does not constitute employment in the sense of the relevant provisions. This article seeks to examine the Greek quota system for women in politics in its dialectical relationship to the general equality discourse and with reference to the current normative framework in Europe. The aims are threefold: to assess the legality of positive action in favour of women in politics from the point of view of EU law, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Greek system in achieving its gender equality goals, and to identify the problems that quotas in politics may pose with regard to the principle of democratic representation. It will, thus, be argued that positive measures in politics, though generally compatible with the fundamental principles of justice and representative democracy, may nevertheless be inadequate-at least in their current form-to provide effective solutions to the unequal distribution of social and political power. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-71949111130","United Kingdom"

To advance understanding of this key term in recent gender politics, we conduct quantitative and qualitative analyses of almost one thousand articles from four major newspapers over a forty-year period that mention the term gender neutral. The term arises in news articles discussing gender equality between women and men, lesbian and gay rights, and transgender rights. Those articles discussing gender equality between women and men, however, tend not to discuss LGBT rights. Likewise, those articles that discuss LGBT rights rarely discuss gender equality. Moreover, we identify three distinct ways of framing gender neutrality and show that they are differentially associated with reporting on gender equality between women and men, sexual orientation, or gender identity, respectively. By showing how these three frames represent distinct challenges to prevailing gender arrangements, this article advances theoretical understanding of undoing and redoing gender. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

This survey was conducted from January to June, 2011 in a multistage, random sample of men from urban Dhaka and rural Matlab sub-district of Chandpur district. Analyses included ever-partnered men (N = 1,572). In unadjusted structural equation models, men who reported controlling behavior had higher average life satisfaction; whereas, those reporting psychological IPV perpetration had lower life satisfaction. Adjusting for covariates, men’s controlling behavior remained positively associated with their life satisfaction, while psychological and physical IPV perpetration were negatively associated with life satisfaction. In Bangladesh, men’s controlling behavior may be so central to normative masculinity that it is internalized, and its instrumental success enhances men’s life satisfaction. Yet, the adverse influence of IPV perpetration on life satisfaction supports social-psychological theories of self-determination, whereby behaviors that are normative but not internalized undermine men’s psychological needs, contributing to lower life satisfaction. In settings like Bangladesh, integrated theories of masculinity under patriarchy and self-determination may be needed to understand men’s coercive control, IPV perpetration, and well-being. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84957536998","Bangladesh"
"205",2017,"Quality and Quantity","Clusters of cultures: diversity in meaning of family value and gender role items across Europe","Survey data are often used to map cultural diversity by aggregating scores of attitude and value items across countries. However, this procedure only makes sense if the same concept is measured in all countries. In this study we argue that when (co)variances among sets of items are similar across countries, these countries share a common way of assigning meaning to the items. Clusters of cultures can then be observed by doing a cluster analysis on the (co)variance matrices of sets of related items. This study focuses on family values and gender role attitudes. We find four clusters of cultures that assign a distinct meaning to these items, especially in the case of gender roles. Some of these differences reflect response style behavior in the form of acquiescence. Adjusting for this style effect impacts on country comparisons hence demonstrating the usefulness of investigating the patterns of meaning given to sets of items prior to aggregating scores into cultural characteristics. © 2016, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-84991106445","Netherlands"

This article seeks to make two key contributions to understandings of the relationships between gender, sexuality and political economy. The first is recognition of the tensions and contradictions inherent within practices of neoliberalisation. It is suggested that neoliberalism can be both generative and hostile towards LGBTQ politics. Processes of neoliberalisation produce queer winners and losers, and it is suggested that if sexually progressive alternatives to neoliberalism are to be developed, they need to recognise the tensions and contradictions inherent within processes of neoliberalism. In so doing, the class dimensions of neoliberal sexualities need to be made visible and examined critically. Secondly, it is argued that discussions of classed sexualities are often framed within specific national contexts, and thereby fail to recognise the transnational dimensions of classed sexualities. Discussions of the sexual politics of neoliberalism are often grounded in Anglo-American contexts and sometimes fail to recognise how neoliberal sexualities are framed outside of the West. These two key objectives are addressed by an examination of the economic and class dimensions of contemporary LGBTQ political struggles in Poland-specifically the organisation of marches for equality and tolerance within Polish cities since 2001. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84900301024","United Kingdom"

According to the role-model hypothesis, the gender match between scientist and influencer is paramount (for example, women scientists would disproportionately often mention their mothers as career influencers). According to the opportunity-structure hypothesis, the parent's educational level predicts his/her probability of being mentioned as a career influencer (that is, parents with higher educational levels would be more likely to be named). The examination of a sample of American scientists who had received prestigious postdoctoral fellowships resulted in rejecting the role-model hypothesis and corroborating the opportunity-structure hypothesis. There were a few additional findings. First, women scientists were more likely than men scientists to mention parental influencers. Second, fathers were more likely than mothers to be mentioned as influencers. Third, an interaction was found between the scientist's gender and parental education when predicting a parent's nomination as influencer. © The Author(s), 2009.","2-s2.0-70450217549","United States"

Preciado's Testo Junkie (2013) suggests a reconceptualization of the Situationist dérive as a practice of molecular becoming. In this essay, I offer Preciado's work as a way of understanding how queer dramaturgies may involve something other than a stable, coherent subject and instead figure what Rosi Braidotti has theorised as a non-unitary or nomadic mode of subjectivity. At the same time, Preciado's emphasis on the spatial, cultural and ‘pharmaco-pornographic’ conditions which materialise the contemporary subject may usefully resist renditions of the queer or trans subject as endlessly or effortlessly fluid. In exploring these ideas, I consider two performances–Rosana Cade's Walking: Holding (2011) and Nando Messias’ The Sissy's Progress ­­(2014)–as articulating the necessity for queer, trans and gender non-conforming people to appear in public spaces while simultaneously foregrounding the literal, material conditions -- and risks -- attached to gender that drifts from its most normative instance. These works invite us to rethink the potential of queer spatiality in terms of contact, exposure and situated embodiment. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85060994802","S."

However, most cross-national research examining this association is limited to developing countries and has used limited measures of gender inequity and child homicides as a proxy for child maltreatment. To examine the relationship between gender inequity and child maltreatment, we used caregivers’ reported use of severe physical punishment (proxy for physical abuse) and children under 5 left alone or under the care of another child younger than 10 years of age (supervisory neglect) and three indices of gender inequity (the Social and Institutional Gender Index, the Gender Inequality Index, and the Gender Gap Index) from 57 countries, over half of which were developing countries.

By isolating a selection of minor paintings from that legacy - including Chain Saw Heart (Portrait of Joaquin Aganza) (1984), Rapture (1988), and Stanton Near Forsyth Street (1983) - the author contends that a poetics of proximity unfolds through which the national, racial, sexual, and even aesthetic internal orders of Nuyorico are suspended, disturbed, and reframed.

The gender gap in desired and realised wages","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study gender differences in wage bargaining by comparing the unexplained wage gap in desired, realised and reservation wages. Design/methodology/approach: The notion of desired wages is applied, which shows workers’ first bet to potential employers during the job-search process. A large job-search data set is drawn from the main Estonian electronic job-search site CV Keskus. Findings: It is found that the unexplained gender wage gap is around 20 per cent in desired wages and in realised wages, which supports the view that the gender income gap in expectations compares well with the realised income gap. The unexplained gender wage gap is larger in desired wages than in reservation wages for unemployed individuals, and this suggests that women ask for wages that are closer to their reservation wages men do. Occupational and sectoral mobility is unable to explain a significant additional part of the gender wage gap. Originality/value: The paper adds to the scarce empirical evidence on the role of the non-experimental wage negotiation process in the gender wage gap. In addition, the authors seek to explain one of the largest unexplained gender wage gaps in Europe, the one in Estonia, by introducing a novel set of variables for occupational and sectoral mobility from a lengthy retrospective panel. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85029000434","Estonia"

Malabon City in Metro Manila is characterized by such risk factors to disasters. The target population of this study were women as they frequently remain at home while their husbands are out for work. The methodologies were both qualitative and quantitative through the use of key expert and subject interviews, and a survey questionnaire respectively. The objectives of the study were to look into the structure of Philippine disaster management, to investigate the role of institutions in the vulnerability of women to local disasters, and to identify the various experiences of disasters among women. The data showed that gender sensitivity was not included in reaching out to victims of disasters and that resilience is associated with reverting back to pre-disaster conditions without any mechanisms for preventing disasters. From the data, it can be surmised too that institutional intervention was not sufficient to mitigate the adverse effects of disasters due to its weak contribution to gendered social protection, the existence of politically induced discrimination, and the inadequacy of the services of the government. The vulnerability of households and communities to disaster occurrence is dependent on the interplay between natural and socioeconomic conditions. In this interplay, the institutional role is vital in responding to mitigating natural disasters and to improve socio-economic conditions both before and after disasters. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.","2-s2.0-85028719947","Philippines"

A national sample of 123 mental health professionals (57.7% male) provided clinical judgments on 12 case vignettes primarily representing personality pathology; two identical versions of each vignette were prepared, with the only difference being the use of masculine or feminine pronouns identifying the client. Clinical judgments included evaluations of adaptive functioning, long-term prognostic assessments, short-term risk evaluations, and treatment recommendations. Analyses included intraclass correlations between clinicians to assess reliability, as well as an examination of the variance of clinical judgments as a function of the identified gender of the case and the gender of the participating clinician. No significant two-way interactions were found between case gender and clinician gender in predicting the clinical judgments. A significant main effect of case gender in predicting vocational functioning was observed, such that female cases were rated as having better estimated vocational functioning than male cases. In addition, a significant main effect of clinician gender in predicting aggression and violence risk was found, such that ratings by female clinicians were higher than ratings by male clinicians.

It draws on a poststructuralist approach to empirical analysis that is informed by Sondergaard who argues for the need to attend to the 'constitution of social practices and cultural patterns' through which subjects make sense of their lived experiences. This approach, it is argued, is supported by Convery who stresses the need to 'sensitively confront' the identity claims that are inscribed through teacher narratives. In this sense, the author provides an account of the dynamics of masculinity in two male elementary school teachers' lives, which attend to issues of sexuality and social class in examining how gendered identity management impacts on pedagogical practices and philosophical approaches to teaching. This poststructuralist analytic inquiry, with its emphasis on interrogating essentialized notions of fixed identity, illuminates the contradictory practices of hegemonic masculinity in male elementary school teachers' lives. Such empirical inquiry, it is further argued, is necessary given the failure of educational policy, in its insistence on the need for more male role models in elementary schools, to deal adequately with the complexities and significance of male teachers' masculinities.","2-s2.0-57049117403","Canada"

We assume that there are no gender differences in the human capital technology and calibrate this technology using wage-age profiles of men. The calibration of females assumes that children involves a forced reduction in hours of work that falls on females rather than on males and that there is an exogenous gender gap in hours of work. We find that our theory accounts for all of the increase in the gender wage gap over the life cycle in the NLSY79 data. The impact of children on the labor supply of females accounts for 56% and 45% of the increase in the gender wage gap over the life cycle among non-college and college females, while the rest is due to the exogenous gender differences in hours of work. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-84962506657","Canada"

Part 2 evaluates Hamby's results as if they were correct and shows women perpetrated 2/3 as much partner violence (PV) as men and that it is frequent and a serious problem needing immediate attention. Part 3 describes a mode of conceptualization and data analysis called Dyadic Concordance Types (DCTs), which measures PV at the couple level rather than the individual perpetrator level, by classifying couples as Male-Only, Female-Only, and Both assaulted. Reviews of more than 50 studies found about half of couples are in the Both assaulted category, about a quarter Male-Only, as well as Female-Only. This applies to treatment-involved cases, to data provided by women and men, moderate and severe forms of physical violence, and regardless of the instrument used to measure physical assault. DCTs provide a more realistic and comprehensive assessment of PV because they take into account both gendered and dyadic interaction aspects of PV and both victimization and perpetration. Identifying the DCTs of cases in research or interventions is a practical step to enhance research and increase the effectiveness of services by directing attention to analyzing and treating PV as a couple problem, while also identifying sole-perpetrators.

Different interviewed women value the male pragmatism in driving; while mature women consider it as a """"natural"""" masculine attribute, young women adopt it in their own driving practices as a mean to avoid gender stigmatization. However, such a pragmatism is opposed to traffic legal rules and due respect towards other people in the public space and, as long as young women take masculine driving style as their model, the risk of traffic injuries would surely increase.

"232",2011,"Sex Roles","Sarah Palin, A Nation Object(ifie)s: The Role of Appearance Focus in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election","In 2008, Republican John McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, lost the U. S. presidential election to Barack Obama and his vice presidential candidate, Joe Biden. During the campaign, Palin's physical appearance, including her reported $150,000 makeover, received extensive media coverage. But, could the focus on her appearance have impacted the outcome of the election? Several lines of laboratory research suggest that this focus may have been detrimental to the Republican ticket because 1) it likely undermined perceptions of Palin's competence, warmth and morality, and 2) it may have increased Palin's focus on her own appearance, which, consistent with research on self-objectification, likely impaired the competency of her actual performance. Voting research supports the importance of candidates' perceived competence and character. Thus, while acknowledging the diverse influences on an election's outcome, a strong empirical case can be made that people objected to Sarah Palin (and therefore, John McCain), in part, because she was objectified. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that men suffer these same consequences when others, or they themselves, focus on their appearance. Therefore, it is not likely that the Democratic Obama-Biden ticket was hurt by these same factors. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-79959792602","United States"

Few studies examine whether a similar phenomenon extends to females. Additionally, few studies investigate how family attachment affects belief in an oppositional culture that Anderson calls """"street codes."""" Using data from the National Youth Survey, the present study addresses these issues by examining whether boys actually embrace street codes more than girls, whether family attachment reduces the likelihood of street code adoption for both boys and girls, and whether the magnitude of the effect of family attachment on street code adoption differs between boys and girls. Ordinary least squares regression results indicate that boys embrace street codes more than girls, but a substantial number of females embrace them as well.

Employing a community-based collaborative approach, we constructed a community-informed socioecological conceptual model from a feminist perspective, detailing how armed conflict relates to GBV in a conflict-affected rural community in Northeastern Uganda. The research questions were as follows: (1) How does the community conceptualize GBV? and (2) How does armed conflict relate to GBV? Nine focus group discussions divided by gender, age, and profession and six key informant interviews were conducted. Participants’ ages ranged from 9 to 80 years (n = 34 girls/women, n = 43 boys/men). Grounded theory was used in analysis. Participants conceptualized eight forms of and 22 interactive variables that contributed to GBV. Armed conflict affected physical violence/quarreling, sexual violence, early marriage, and land grabbing via a direct pathway and four indirect pathways initiated through looting of resources, militarization of the community, death of a parent(s) or husband, and sexual violence. The findings suggest that community, organizational, and policy-level interventions, which include attention to intersecting vulnerabilities for exposure to GBV in conflict-affected settings, should be prioritized. While tertiary psychological interventions with women and girls affected by GBV in these areas should not be eliminated, we suggest that policy makers and members of community and organizational efforts make systemic and structural changes.

Seeking to take Eddy seriously as a theologian, I investigate how her multivalent views on women's rights sit within her millennialist soteriology and compare the gendered aspects of her reforming theology to the work of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

The present study, which is based on the social constructionist view of gender, examines how the endorsement of masculinity among heterosexual male Momo users is associated with the number of casual sex partners they meet on the app. The study also explores the mediating role of the sex motive for using Momo. Analyses of survey data from 125 heterosexual male Momo users showed that the endorsement of masculinity had an indirect positive relationship with the number of sex partners mediated by the sex motive; at the same time, it had a direct but negative association with the number of sex partners. These paradoxical associations were explained by different patterns across the individual dimensions of masculinity ideology. Specifically, the dimension of the Importance of Sex was responsible for the positive indirect association whereas the dimension of Avoidance of Femininity was responsible for the negative direct association. These findings are discussed in relation to the wen-wu dyad of Chinese masculinity. Because unsafe sex has been found to be associated with the use of geosocial networking apps, my study also calls for integrating the concept of practicing safer sex with the cultural ideal of masculinity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85060176488","United States"

We use a national survey, the 2006 Economic Decision Making Survey conducted by Michigan State University's Institute for Public Policy and Social Research, to examine the proposition.

Based on this diagnosis, the objective of this article is to identify which are the main stereotypes that hinder women's access to justice in cases of rape, and to understand how these stereotypes act on the three levels in which they are entrenched in society: individual, collective and more general. In order to do so, we analyze first-degree sentences of Tribunal de Justiça do Estado de São Paulo, of the year 2016. Although the sample that supported the study is limited to 63 sentences, it was possible to verify that the women have their statements well valued only if they correspond to the ideal of an honest woman and if they seem to have been victims; otherwise they are portrayed as someone to be distrusted, passing quickly and often from victims to guilty. In this context, the honest woman stereotype, as well as the victim stereotypes, act as cognitive shortcuts in judicial decisions making, leading to biased sentences that ignore the peculiarities of the concrete cases. Similarly, these stereotypes support and are supported, collectively and more generally, by a social structure that subordinates women. We hope that the identification of these stereotypes and the search for explanations about their performance in the three levels in which they are entrenched in society will help formulate public policies that aim to mitigate these stereotypes and their effects and thus guarantee the effectiveness of women's access to justice. © 2018 Centro Universitario de Brasilia.

I employ Facebook as a case study and speak with young adult users to comprehend how socially marginalized groups are perceived through Facebook’s affordances. In particular, I consider: How familiar are users with Facebook’s tools and functionalities? How are issues of gender and race represented through the site’s interface? How do users conceive of gender and race? The findings suggest that gender is perceived as a more important identifier than race and that Facebook is post-racial, because of the user interface choices made. In addition, my participants view Facebook as an official social space that should include “authentic” identities; although Facebook has shaped authentic to mean accurate. I conclude that while the construction of affordances is a negotiation between user, interface, and designer, the designers have the most power because they have created the spaces in ways that will most benefit Facebook. In addition, users who are more situated in the socio-cultural majority have no desire to enact agency within Facebook’s structure because they are accustomed to forms and official documents that are well suited to fit their identification needs. © The Author(s) 2017.","2-s2.0-85046762983","United States"

To perform these tasks, when there are no nearby water sources women have to travel long distances to search for water... and where no clean water sources exist, are exposed to disease from unhygienic sources like drains, ditches or streams including shared sources with animals.

Despite much criticism from experts and researchers which shows there are major gender-related problems, responsible state officials and institutions remained resistant to the issue. This policy of inactivity is studied from the perspective of constructivist policy analysis. The aim of the paper is to show how the discursive practices of treating and understandings the issue of gender equality constitute gender equality as something that is unproblematic and/or located on the periphery of or even outside science itself. In this way, gender equality is pushed outside the realm of science policy, and the status quo remains untouched and unproblematised. If gender equality is thematised at all, it is reduced to the issue of women in science. Such an understanding of gender equality significantly narrows the space in which concrete political measures can be adopted, while also determining which activities are acceptable and which are not, and who is responsible for the situation and its solution. © 2014 Hana Tenglerová.","2-s2.0-84905396644","Czech Republic"

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews with respondents from multinational corporations in India and Germany were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed. Findings - Employers followed three guiding principles (i.e. beliefs): importance of harnessing diversity, encouraging multi-stakeholder engagement internally, and engaging with the external ecosystem to build internal human resource capabilities. Respondents further noted two interdependent and mutually constitutive programs that covered the life cycle of the employee: job flexibility provisions and integration programs. Country-specific differences existed in terms of perceived external stakeholder support and availability of talent. Research limitations/implications - The results complement prior research with respect to the importance of organizational factors for the inclusion of persons with a disability and also extend prior research by shedding light on the role of the national context in such inclusion endeavors. Practical implications - Findings indicate that disability-inclusion principles may be universal, but their operationalization is region specific. Global organizations must be aware of these differences to design effective inclusion programs. Social implications - The study helps in designing and evaluating appropriate inclusion initiatives for persons with disabilities, an important yet underutilized group of potential employees in both India and Germany.

It is becoming a prevalent phenomenon for retirees transitioning from employment to complete work withdrawal. Building on existing literature on retirement transition and older adults' work motivation, the present study examined the effects of 3 motivational orientations (i.e., status striving, communion striving, and generativity striving) in relating to retirees' bridge employment participation (i.e., bridge employment status and bridge employment work hours). This study also applied the social gender role theory to examine the effect of gender in moderating the effects of motivational orientations. Data from 507 Chinese retirees in Beijing revealed that communion striving and generativity striving were positively related to bridge employment participation. Further, gender moderated the effect of status striving such that status striving was positively related to bridge employment participation for male retirees but not for female retirees. In addition, exploratory analysis was conducted to examine the effects of the same set of motivational orientations on postretirement volunteering activities. Results showed that status striving was negatively related to volunteering after retirement.

"257",2017,"International Journal of Interdisciplinary Civic and Political Studies","Religiosity, gender, and political participation in rural areas of Imo State, Nigeria","That there is a connection between religion and politics in Nigeria is no longer contentious. However, what is unclear is the nature and direction of this relationship about the political behaviours of individuals in Nigeria. As uncertain as this relationship is in Nigeria, the impact of religiosity on political participation has so far received little attention; consequently, research in this direction is very minimal. Previous studies on the relationship between religiosity and political participation were mostly done outside Nigeria and in culturally diverse settings. Moreover, the studies showed discrepancies in their findings. Furthermore, researchers have conducted very few of these studies in Nigeria. Understanding this impact is pertinent, especially in a democratic and culturally similar setting like rural areas of Nigeria, where the majority of the people live. This study, therefore, examined the impact of religiosity on political participation in rural communities of Imo State, with particular reference to the Christian religion. It also investigated how the impact varied by gender, among others. The researchers hypothesized that: religiosity has an impact on the political participation of rural dwellers; and that the impact varies significantly by gender. Weber's thesis on Religion formed the theoretical framework for the study. The researchers collected the data through questionnaire and in-depth interview. The indicators of religiosity were a belief in God, the frequency of participation in church activities, commitment to religious rites/principles. Both conventional and unconventional forms of political participation were measured. The indicators of conventional political participation were registration to vote, voting, attendance of political meetings, involvement in campaigns, competing for positions, membership of a political party, writing and making political speech, writing or signing petitions. The indicators of unconventional political participation were involvement in thuggery, snatching of ballot box, protests, rioting and manipulation of voters' cards. Persons from eighteen years and above formed the target population, and the sample size was 327 respondents. Analytical techniques included both descriptive and inferential statistical tools. The researchers found, among others, that religiosity strongly predicted political participation of rural dwellers as persons found to be active in religious activities was not active in political activities. The Researchers recommended among others that; religious leaders and groups should educate their members on the importance of participating actively in the political system. © 2017 Common Ground Research Networks, Benedict E.

Analysing images of political campaigns and activists as well as public discourses on motherhood, abortion and childcare, I will illustrate the importance that gender and sexuality assumed in German nation-building projects before and after its unification in 1990. After 1949, East and West German ideas of nationhood were premised on opposing ideas of gender roles, in that politicians within these two German nations mobilised distinct gender identities to assert their respective political system as superior and progressive. While in East Germany, the progressiveness of the socialist project was measured along the lines of women's integration into the labour force; in West Germany, the idea that a woman's identity was primarily rooted in motherhood played an influential role in nationalist discourses. Once East and West Germany reunified in 1990, these opposing ideas of gender roles clashed. This became particularly visible in the context of political debates around abortion and childcare. An analysis of these debates suggests that the """"new"""" unified German nation was premised upon a story in which the West German idea of the housewife-breadwinner model prevailed. This was diametrically opposed to what was framed as the East German """"woman-worker"""" who had free access to abortion, and was abjected as immoral and backward. Analysing how such a national story was constructed is highly valuable, as it elucidates the ways in which gender has become a constitutive and structural element in the nation-building process of unified Germany to the present day. © 2017 Journal of International Women's Studies.""","2-s2.0-85013350339","United Kingdom"

Ultimately, it suggests that for queer Hmong American youth, identity negotiations are perhaps less about an outward journey of self-realization and more about an interpersonal journey where “going home” is possible and paramount. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84928473253","United States"

The methodology used is analysis of linear regression, and analysis of variances (Anova). The statistical analysis offers the conclusion that the presence of women the Boards of the companies studied does not entail any impairment of the results of the business, and therefore, it is not understood that they do not have access to such posts on the same conditions as their male colleagues.","2-s2.0-83155181777","Spain"

This short essay shares some of the post-disaster experiences, challenges and discussions of the LGBT community in Japan. Reports coming out of the LGBT community have stressed that pre-disaster discrimination and fears of discrimination and repression among LGBT people have hampered their recovery. There is a real fear of being discriminated against and having their family and friends discriminated against. This situation has led to the isolation and vulnerability of LGBT individuals. Despite the majority being reluctant to come out publically, the disaster forced numerous individuals to reveal their gender identity, particularly when confronted with life in shelters, the lack of supply of medication and so on. In turn, this has resulted in instances of discrimination and bullying. These accounts reveal that the main aims of disaster policies and disaster ethics–based on addressing the greatest good of the majority–largely fail to cater for LGBT people, who are not only victims of the disaster but can also be valuable contributors in the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) process. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85014552166","New Zealand"
"264",2006,"Social Politics","Policy, preferences, and patriarchy: The division of domestic labor in East Germany, West Germany, and the United States","Individual agency observed in the gendered division of labor is shaped by structural factors, but only recently has evidence emerged that the effect of women's resources varies systematically in its sociopolitical context. Here we use the 1994 International Social Survey Program to assess whether the relative effect of a proxy for women's and men's preferences - hallmark of individual choice - varies as well across three countries with divergent historical policy approaches regarding the private sphere. East German socialist policies required and supported women's employment; West German policy promulgated a male breadwinner model, and U.S. policy primarily remains silent on the private sphere. The division of domestic tasks and relative strength of individual preferences on shifting it vary by region. In the former East Germany the division of domestic labor is more egalitarian and the effect of preferences is small but equal for the genders. In West Germany the division is more traditional and preference effects are greater, but gender differences in these are insignificant. The U.S. division of domestic task falls between the two German regions, and the gender difference in preference effects is the greatest, with U.S. men's preferences predicting significantly more variance than do U.S. women's. Consequently, allowing the market to dominate does not yield equal strength of preferences in the individual-level models used to predict the division of domestic tasks. This supports the dual-system feminist claims that capitalism can exacerbate nonmarket patriarchal hierarchies.","2-s2.0-33645080676","L.P."

A case study of lifestyle blogs in the U.S.","This article explores contemporary portrayals of women and femininity in lifestyle blogs written and edited by millennial women in the United States. Based on a sample of three of the most popular lifestyle blogs currently in the U.S. this article attempts to identify and describe current portrayals of women to determine if they support a progressive or a conservative approach to femininity. The study we present in this paper is based on a dual methodology: content analysis and discourse analysis. Content analysis allows us to identify topics covered by the selected lifestyle blogs and their categorizations (sections in which they are published) whereas the discourse analysis helps determine the presence or absence of women stereotypes and how gender is represented. Results show some affinity between lifestyle blogs and women magazines with regards to topics covered although the editorial tone is more progressive in lifestyle blogs, leaning towards feminism and discarding conservative representations of femininity. © 2017, Addleton Academic Publishers.

Contested spaces of women's basketball","The Women's National Basketball Association is a professional women's basketball league that is notable for constructing a heteronormative 'family friendly' self-image while maintaining a sizable following of lesbian fans. This article examines this apparent contradiction through two case studies: a kiss-in protest by a group of New York WNBA fans, Lesbians for Liberty, and experiences by Minnesota Lynx lesbian fans of the marketing tactics and daily practices that regulate WNBA game spaces. By highlighting the socio-spatiality of the WNBA venue, it becomes clear how heteronormativity is naturalized, as well as accepted and resisted by lesbian fans in both New York and Minnesota. An overt act of resistance, however, failed to encourage the WNBA to reconsider its policies: the Liberty kiss-in, by situating lesbians as a counterpublic, foreclosed the range of attitudes held by lesbian fans. Moreover, as Minnesota Lynx fans demonstrate, WNBA spaces feel 'safe enough' to many lesbian fans. As a result, there remains a contest over the meanings and practices that define WNBA landscapes. To date, however, normative heterosexuality has contained the presence and visibility of the lesbian fan.","2-s2.0-33846471629","United States"

While many commentators and scholars have acknowledged the educational qualities of pornography, there is no universal consensus as to what porn teaches its consumers and how it works as an educator. Pornography is increasingly itself the subject of educational texts, with ‘porn literacy’ being debated as a potential addition to the secondary state school curriculum in the United Kingdom and Australia. This article presents an overview of the field of ‘porn as pedagogy’ and pedagogy about porn. It is modest in scope, relying primarily on recent research and media reportage from Australasia, North America and the United Kingdom. These Anglophone countries have significant similarities in respect to the ways pornography is framed as a moral and/or political issue within public debate (although there are also notable differences). For this reason, the overview that follows does not seek to be globally representative, but represents a preliminary foray into a complex and diverse field. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84962727627","Australia"

We investigate whether indeed highly educated women are less likely to marry than their less-educated counterparts, and how assortative mating patterns by age and education play a role in singleness. Methods We use data from the urban samples of the Chinese General Social Surveys in the 2000s. In the analysis we calculate marriage rates to examine the likelihood of entry into marriage, and then apply log-linear models to investigate the assortative mating patterns by age and education. Results We find that as education increases, the likelihood of marriage increases among men but decreases among women, especially among those over age 30. The results from log-linear models reveal that more marriages involve better-educated, older men and less-educated, younger women. Conclusions We argue that persistent traditional gender roles, accompanied by the rapid rise in women's education, contribute to low marriage rates among older, highly educated women. © 2014 Yue Qian and Zhenchao Qian.""","2-s2.0-84920266100","United States"

Finnish adult internet users were contacted via e-mail and asked to fill an internet questionnaire consisting of questions of food risks and measures of avoidance and approach motivation, analytic and intuitive information processing style, trait anxiety, and gender in order to find out (1) whether food risks are perceived two-dimensionally, (2) how individual differences in motivation, information processing, and anxiety are associated with the different dimensions of food risk perceptions, and (3) whether gender moderates these associations. The data were analyzed by factor, correlation and regression analyses. Three factors emerged: risk scariness, risk likelihood, and risks of cardiovascular disease. Personality and gender×personality interactions predicted food risk perceptions. Results showed that food risk perceptions generally form two dimensions; scariness and likelihood, but that this may depend on the nature of the risk. In addition, results imply that individuals with high avoidance motivation perceive food risks as scarier and more likely than others, and that individuals with an analytic information processing style perceive food risks as less likely than others. Trait anxiety seems to be associated with higher food risk perceptions only among men. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-33846088455","Finland"

To this end, we have created a micro database that compiles 248 surveys from 53 countries between 1967 and 2014, covering a wide range of per capita income levels. There is large convergence in the earnings of men and women over the path of development, driven by female labour force participation and wage rates. We argue that the single most important factor behind this convergence is demographic transition: the effects of children on gender gaps (‘child penalties’) are large at both low and high levels of development, but fertility declines drastically over the growth process and thus reduces the aggregate implications of children. We also document gender convergence in educational attainment and consider its effects on earnings inequality, arguing that these are significant but less dramatic than the effects of fertility. Finally, we document striking changes in the values or norms surrounding the role of women with children, implying that such changes could serve as a reinforcing mechanism for gender convergence. © 2017 The London School of Economics and Political Science","2-s2.0-85015204785","United Kingdom"

The sample included 128 children selected by simple random sampling from 5-6 year old children, receiving preschool education in the city centre of Ýzmir province in Turkey. Of the children, 65 were girls (50.8%) and 63 (49.2%) were boys. The data collection instruments were the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales and the Short Temperament Scale for Children, respectively. The results of this study reveal that there is no significiant difference between gender and the child temperament subscales of approach/withdrawal; persistence and rhythmicity; and a child's behavioural problems, respectively. However, the gender of the children was found to be significantly related to the reactivity sub-dimension of their temperament (p < 0.05). Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between the temperament subscale of reactivity and externalising problems subscale of behavioural problems (p < 0.05). On the other hand, a negative correlation was observed between the persistence temperament dimension and the behavioural problem dimension of self-centredness (p < 0.05). In the opinion of the researcher, it is important to know the children's personality features, monitor their behaviour, and take respective measures when necessary.

This paper investigates the intergenerational persistence of health across time and region as well as across the distribution of maternal health. It uses comparable microdata on as many as 2.24. million children born of about 0.6. million mothers in 38 developing countries in the 31. year period, 1970-2000. Mother's health is indicated by her height, BMI and anemia status. Child health is indicated by mortality risk and anthropometric failure. We find a positive relationship between maternal and child health across indicators and highlight non-linearities in these relationships. The results suggest that both contemporary and childhood health of the mother matter and that the benefits to the next generation are likely to be persistent. Averaging across the sample, persistence shows a considerable decline over time. Disaggregation shows that the decline is only significant in Latin America. Persistence has remained largely constant in Asia and has risen in Africa.

The literature is characterized by what might be referred to as the 'absent women' discourse, namely the underrepresentation of women in the highest positions in the sector, and is dominated by research conducted in the West. It is key, however, to look beyond the Western academy and not make assumptions about the status, position and experience of women academics in other contexts, or to assume that priority is given to gender equity universally. A key aspect from a policy perspective and in relation to supporting the advancement of women as academics is data: the absence of adequate, publically accessible data results in higher education sectors not being open to scrutiny. The purpose of this article is two-fold: first, the issue of absent data in the East Asian context - using Hong Kong as an example - is discussed.

Self-body-care extends understandings of body work as part of postfeminist governmentality and contributes to understandings of moderate feminism as that which deflects and reflects feminism and constrains and empowers subjects. As such self-body-care offers an (im)perfect space for disruption and for Gender and Organization Studies (GOS) scholars to pursue the implications and potential of postfeminism. We call for women elite leaders to be part of feminist futures and illustrate self-body-care as an aspect of corporate moderate feminism by highlighting complexity in the postfeminist thesis and reflexively re-examining two of our previous published empirical studies of women ‘top’ leaders. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2-s2.0-85053451249","Canada"

Results: Less than half of adults were physically active at baseline. The probability of physical activity declined over the 6-year period, with no significant gender variation in the effect of time. Because the odds of physical activity were lower for women at baseline and the effect of time did not vary by gender, the trajectory of physical activity was less favorable for women than men.

Both films are set in the seventeenth century and use the theatre as a central metaphor to describe and capture the cultural sensibilities of Restoration England. Both are based on stage plays in which theatre also functions as a site of resistance to cultural and social norms of gender and sexual politics. However, both films end by reinscribing and reaffirming the norms they set out to question, as transgressive desire is preempted and contained by an aesthetics of spectacle.

"284",2016,"Journal of Evidence-Informed Social Work","Complementing gender analysis methods","The existing gender analysis frameworks start with a premise that men and women are equal and should be treated equally. These frameworks give emphasis on equal distribution of resources between men and women and believe that this will bring equality which is not always true. Despite equal distribution of resources, women tend to suffer and experience discrimination in many areas of their lives such as the power to control resources within social relationships, and the need for emotional security and reproductive rights within interpersonal relationships. These frameworks believe that patriarchy as an institution plays an important role in women’s oppression, exploitation, and it is a barrier in their empowerment and rights. Thus, some think that by ensuring equal distribution of resources and empowering women economically, institutions like patriarchy can be challenged. These frameworks are based on proposed equality principle which puts men and women in competing roles. Thus, the real equality will never be achieved. Contrary to the existing gender analysis frameworks, the Complementing Gender Analysis framework proposed by the author provides a new approach toward gender analysis which not only recognizes the role of economic empowerment and equal distribution of resources but suggests to incorporate the concept and role of social capital, equity, and doing gender in gender analysis which is based on perceived equity principle, putting men and women in complementing roles that may lead to equality. In this article the author reviews the mainstream gender theories in development from the viewpoint of the complementary roles of gender. This alternative view is argued based on existing literature and an anecdote of observations made by the author. While criticizing the equality theory, the author offers equity theory in resolving the gender conflict by using the concept of social and psychological capital. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85014839618","India"

Drawing on data from the Health and Retirement Study, this study examined the moderating effects of age, gender, and full-time employment on married women’s and men’s receipt of spousal care. This study found that among community-dwelling married adults, the gender gap in care was larger among those in middle age (50–65) than it was among those in older age. As women and men aged, the gender gap decreased primarily because men left full-time work and increased the amount of time that they spent caring for their wives.

"291",2016,"Contemporary Music Review","Shifting Gender in Electronic Music: DIY and Maker Communities","The rise in DIY and maker communities that has taken place over the last decade, including the growth of Hackspaces, Fab Labs and Maker Spaces, is not just about making: at its core it is a political development. It has been concerned with the empowerment of the individual in global, corporate societies, and with democracy on many different levels, gender included. There has been significant crossover between crafting communities such as Etsy and hackspaces. Make magazine and Maker Faires have brought practical projects and arts and crafts activities alongside ‘tech’ in a neo-renaissance arts/science mash-up. Traditional roles and stereotypes have been questioned in the process. Electronic music has also been influenced by these cultural phenomena. In this article, DIY and maker communities and a maker’s ethos will be discussed in relation to issues of gender imbalance in electronic music as they exist particularly within academic institutions in the UK. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-84979055709","J."

Factors Influencing Parental Decisions Among Lesbians and Gay Men","Few studies have examined lesbians’ and gay men’s parental decision-making processes. Our goal in this work was to review what literature says about this understudied area of research. We first looked at transformations that have made it possible for lesbian- and gay-parented families to gain visibility. We then described how parental aspirations of lesbians and gay men have been operationalized. Factors shaping parental decisions were categorized as sociodemographic (gender, age and cohort, and race/ethnicity), personal (internalization of anti-homosexual prejudice and openness about one’s non-heterosexual orientation), relational (one’s partner’s parental motivation and social support), and contextual (work conditions, access to LGBT support networks, information and resources, and social, legal, and medical barriers). Research findings were discussed and implications for future research and social policies regarding the issue of prospective lesbian and gay parenthood were drawn. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84996483686","Portugal"
"293",2017,"Engineering Studies","Technology Change = Gender Change? Androcentric Construction of Engineering as Symbolic Resource in the German-Speaking Area of Renewable Energies","This paper is concerned with how engineers working in renewable energies in Germany and Austria position themselves and their professional activity within this relatively new field of engineering occupation by mobilizing a specific androcentric construction of engineering as a symbolic resource. Drawing on qualitative interviews, the argument unfolds in three steps: First, the paper reconstructs how engineers draft an image of their professional activity by symbolically aligning it with established understandings of engineering in traditional areas of engineering occupation and by simultaneously distancing it from allegedly ‘other’ notions of engineering practice that are framed as ‘alternative’. The discursive distinction between professional engineering and its alleged ‘alternative’ counterpart constitutes the former as hard, sincere, structured, and reliable activity based on an instrumental rationality. Second, it is shown how the professional/alternative distinction is gendered with ‘the alternative’ being devaluated and feminized. Consequently, it is argued that there is an implicit association between the discursively constituted idea of professional engineering and masculinity. Third, this discursive construction of engineering is interpreted as a symbolic resource in the engineers’ claim to be recognized as professional actors within renewable energies and, thus, in their struggle for favourable positions within this social field of power. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85017142642","Germany"

The purpose of the study is to explore and investigate whether and how school violence is gendered and whether acts of violence are being coded as either masculine or feminine. The data were gathered at Swedish secondary schools. The results indicate that gender influences how professionals categorise violence, with physical violence often being considered masculine and relational violence often being considered feminine. As a consequence, boys are perceived as less violent when they are involved in relational violence, and physical violence among girls is not always taken seriously. © 2019, © 2018 The Author(s).

At centre stage are the roles of entrepreneurs, women<U+E4F8>owned small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and socially constructed paradigms of gender in this process. The paper's aim is to explore, through a local<U+E4F8>level case study, the currently ongoing process of gendering and regendering in a female<U+E4F8>dominated sector. This is done by a qualitative real<U+E4F8>time study of the introduction of a customer<U+E4F8>choice system in elder care in a Swedish municipality. Design/methodology/approach – The formal decision in Spring 2008 to introduce a “customer<U+E4F8>choice model” into home<U+E4F8>based elderly care in the municipality is the formal starting point of the research. The authors are given full access to all relevant information and informants including all questions and suggestions from the potential suppliers who were applying to be “authorized and certified suppliers”. Interviews are the main method but also written material like applications and newspaper articles and “letters to the editor” are studied. Findings – The outcome of the changes are, from the decision<U+E4F8>makers point of view, disappointing. The consequences so far of the customer<U+E4F8>choice system, that have been examined here, can be labelled increased masculinism or even a masculinization of the elderly care sector. Whether the polarization is a presage of the process to come is too early to tell. If so, the masculinization observed in this paper extends along three dimensions: governing logic, leadership and ownership. These gender consequences are not those expected or intended by the leading local actors. Research limitations/implications – The study is made in an ongoing process. The politicians are making changes aiming at making better working conditions for SMEs and former employees especially women. It is therefore important to follow up what is going to happen in the future. Comparisons with other municipalities and other regimes, nationally and internationally, would also be valuable. Practical implications – In this case, the practical implications are, almost, the same as the research implications.

"298",2018,"Mindfulness","Does Self-Compassion Facilitate Resilience to Stigma? A School-Based Study of Sexual and Gender Minority Youth","Mental health disparities among sexual and gender minority youth likely reflect a maladaptive coping response to contexts rife with stigma messaging and discrimination. Identifying adaptive coping responses to stigma messages is thus a critical step in reducing the disparities that manifest in adolescence. Guided by the minority stress hypothesis, this secondary data analysis (N = 1821) examined self-compassion (SC) as a potential resilience-promoting response to stigma messages received from bias-based bullying. In addition to accounting for more variation in mental health disparities than bias-based bullying, general victimization, and adverse childhood experiences combined, inclusion of SC in the models dramatically attenuated the impact of bias-based bullying, and finally, rates of bias-based bullying moderated the SC’s mediational effect on mental health symptomology. Furthermore, while the average SC scores were on par with those reported in adolescence elsewhere, examination of differences across sexuality and gender status reveals that sexual and gender minority youth report significantly lower rates of self-compassion, with a medium effect size. In sum, while deficits in SC appear to explain a greater degree of variation in mental health disparities than does exposure to adversity, high SC appears to be protective although rates of bias-based bullying erode its protective effects. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-85042740030","United States"
"299",2016,"Acta Sociologica (United Kingdom)","Attitudes to the gender division of labor and the transition to fatherhood: Are egalitarian men in Sweden more likely to remain childless?","Most European countries, including Sweden, have witnessed considerable postponement of first births over the past several decades, and societal gender equality has been mentioned among the central reasons for the delay in childbearing. Continued postponement of parenthood over the life course can result in “final childlessness,” i.e. the individual will reach the end of his/her reproductive period without having become a parent. As levels of final childlessness have been increasing in most European countries, studies of childlessness have become more common. However, most of these studies deal exclusively with women, and the theorizing regarding what leads to final childlessness, particularly among men, is clearly underdeveloped. In this paper we will contribute to this research area by investigating the long-term relationships between attitudes toward domestic gender equality and men’s transition to parenthood in Sweden. Our dependent variable is a close approximation of “final childlessness.” We use Swedish panel survey data on attitudes to the gender division of labor among still childless young adults aged 22–30 in 1999, combined with register data on births in the period 1999–2012. The article shows that the initial delay in becoming fathers evidenced by more egalitarian men is not made up in the long term. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-84979740881","Sweden"
"300",2010,"Archives of Sexual Behavior","Familiality of gender identity disorder in non-twin siblings","Familial studies and reports of co-occurrence of gender identity disorder (GID) within a family may help to clarify the question of whether transsexualism is a familial phenomenon. In a sample of 995 consecutive transsexual probands (677 male-to-female [MF] and 318 female-to-male [FM]), we report 12 pairs of transsexual non-twin siblings (nine pairs of MF siblings, two pairs of MF-FM siblings, and one pair of FM siblings). The present study doubles the number of case reports of co-occurrence of transsexualism in non-twin siblings available in the literature. According to our data, the probability that a sibling of a transsexual will also be transsexual was 4.48 times higher for siblings of MF than for siblings of FM transsexual probands, and 3.88 times higher for the brothers than for the sisters of transsexual probands. Moreover, the prevalence of transsexualism in siblings of transsexuals (1/211 siblings) was much higher than the range expected according to the prevalence data of transsexualism in Spain. The study suggests that siblings of transsexuals may have a higher risk of being transsexual than the general population, and that the risk is higher for brothers than sisters of transsexuals, and for siblings of MF than FM transsexuals. Nevertheless, the risk is low. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-77952098369","Spain"

Using life-history research, I show that Thatho challenges essentialist assumptions of gender and identity as he enacts multiple masculinities. My article troubles the common typification of men solely as hegemonic, marginalised or subordinate when indeed the actual accounts of their lives are far more fluid than these rigid distinctions. Thatho’s enactment of multiple masculinities talks to the ‘durability or survivability of non-hegemonic patterns of masculinity’ outlined by Connell and Messershmidt [2005. “Hegemonic Masculinity Rethinking the Concept.” Gender & Society 19 (6): 829–859. doi:10.1177/0891243205278639], which in many ways characterises a wellcrafted response to his own marginalisation and stigmatised sexuality. Yet, Thatho’s narrative also suggests a significant flexibility in the gender order in Qwaqwa, which looks different from the sometimes inflexibility of rural society and in some research from the developed world and, perhaps, from some urban contexts in contemporary South Africa. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84905884144","South Africa"

Four different narratives concerning gender can be identified in these testimonies. On the one hand, the reports describe women and men who did not conform to the gender stereotypes of the time. The psychiatrists found the non-conformist defendants to be of unsound mind. On the other hand, women and men who did conform to the gender stereotypes were also described. In those cases, however, “feminine” women were certified insane, whereas “masculine” men were accused of simulating a mental disease in order to avoid punishment.

"307",2018,"Scientometrics","Bias against research on gender bias","The bias against women in academia is a documented phenomenon that has had detrimental consequences, not only for women, but also for the quality of science. First, gender bias in academia affects female scientists, resulting in their underrepresentation in academic institutions, particularly in higher ranks. The second type of gender bias in science relates to some findings applying only to male participants, which produces biased knowledge. Here, we identify a third potentially powerful source of gender bias in academia: the bias against research on gender bias. In a bibliometric investigation covering a broad range of social sciences, we analyzed published articles on gender bias and race bias and established that articles on gender bias are funded less often and published in journals with a lower Impact Factor than articles on comparable instances of social discrimination. This result suggests the possibility of an underappreciation of the phenomenon of gender bias and related research within the academic community. Addressing this meta-bias is crucial for the further examination of gender inequality, which severely affects many women across the world. © 2018, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85042095386","Israel"

We examined the effectiveness of experiential learning using the Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation - Academic version (WAGES-Academic) to deliver gender inequity information. To assess whether the way gender inequity information is presented matters, we compared WAGES-Academic to an Information Only condition (knowledge without experiential learning) and a Group Activity control condition. We predicted that only the information presented in an experiential learning format (i. e., WAGES-Academic) would be retained because this information does not provoke reactance and instills self-efficacy. Participants (n=241; U. S. college students from a large mid-Atlantic state university) filled out a gender equity knowledge test at baseline, after the intervention, and then 7-11 days later (to assess knowledge retention). In addition, we measured feelings of reactance and self-efficacy after the intervention. Results revealed that participants in the WAGES condition retained more knowledge than the other conditions. Furthermore, the effect of WAGES vs. Information Only on knowledge was mediated by WAGES producing less reactance and greater feelings of self-efficacy.

In the opening decade of the twenty-first century Karratha was one of Australia's most affluent towns, yet its adult population was characterised by a level of formal qualifications that was well below the national average. These demographic realities test fundamental beliefs about the functions of education in industrial modernity in ways that help illuminate the importance of Corbett's challenge for educational sociologists to strengthen their commitment to posthumanist studies focused on building sustainable human spaces, particularly in rural areas.

"311",2013,"Computers and Education","Investigating the impact of pedagogical agent gender matching and learner choice on learning outcomes and perceptions","The similarity attraction hypothesis posits that humans are drawn toward others who behave and appear similar to themselves. Two experiments examined this hypothesis with middle-school students learning electrical circuit analysis in a computer-based environment with an Animated Pedagogical Agent (APA). Experiment 1 was designed to determine whether matching the gender of the APA to the student has a positive impact on learning outcomes or student perceptions. One hundred ninety-seven middle-school students learned with the computer-based environment using an APA that matched their gender or one which was opposite in gender. Female students reported higher program ratings when the APA matched their gender. Male students, on the other hand, reported higher program ratings than females when the APA did not match their gender. Experiment 2 systematically tested the impact of providing learners the choice among four APAs on learning outcomes and student perceptions. Three hundred thirty-four middle-school students received either a pre-assigned random APA or were free to choose from four APA options: young male agent, older male agent, young female agent, or older female agent. Learners had higher far transfer scores when provided a choice of animated agent, but student perceptions were not impacted by having the ability to make this choice. We suggest that offering students learner control positively impacts student motivation and learning by increasing student perceptions of autonomy, responsibility for the success of the instructional materials, and global satisfaction with the design of materials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

"312",2019,"Sex Roles","The Power of Language: Gender, Status, and Agency in Performance Evaluations","In the workplace, women often encounter gender stereotypes and biases that reinforce the existing gender hierarchy, may hinder women’s career aspirations and retention, and may limit their ability to be promoted—especially in traditionally male organizations. Long-standing and widely held (although often unconscious) beliefs about gender can reinforce women’s perceived lower status position relative to men’s. Because men are described/prescribed as agentic (often masculine) and women as communal (often feminine), women leaders are often evaluated as being status-incongruent. We explore the gendered assignment of leader attributes with particular attention to associations of agentic competence (deficiency for women) and agentic dominance (penalty for women). We examined peer evaluations of 4344 U.S. Naval Academy students who are assigned attributes from a predefined list. Although men and women received similar numbers of descriptive (positive) attributes, women received more proscriptive (negative) attributes than did men and these individual attributes were predominantly feminine. These findings offer evidence that women leaders’ status incongruity may be associated with perceived competence (agentic deficiency). A contribution of our analysis is theory testing using data from a real-life performance evaluation system. Additionally, our research contributes to our knowledge of gendered language and status characteristics in performance evaluations and can assist researchers and practitioners with developing interventions. Understanding the association of gender status beliefs with evaluation processes may facilitate changing workplace culture to be more gender-inclusive through less biased and stereotypical performance evaluations. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85056926919","Japan"

"315",2017,"Signs","Plasticity and programming: Feminism and the epigenetic imaginary","The new science of epigenetics has raised hopes for an embrace of greater plasticity and variation within the biology of sex, gender, and sexuality than previously appreciated. This essay describes and analyzes the integration of epigenetics research into the scientific study of core biological pathways related to sex, gender, and sexuality in the brain in the post–Human Genome Project era. Through a close reading of the primary scientific literature, it demonstrates that epigenetic approaches in this subfield remain continuous with historically entrenched models of hardwired sexual dimorphism in the brain. Considering the opportunities and dilemmas of feminist engagements with the fast-moving and still-nascent field of epigenetics, it argues that for epigenetics to become a resource for studies of the development and plasticity of gendered-sexed bodies and identities, feminists must contest the ontological and epistemological commitments of mainstream research in this field. Feminist attraction to the possibility that epigenetic research will enable material investigation of gender embodiment and sexual variation follows from a long tradition of feminist theoretical interest in plasticity-affirming biologies. Careful consideration of the case of epigenetics suggests a need for revised and more nuanced feminist appraisals of both plasticity-affirming and programming-centric models of biology, body, and sociality. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

Relevant to the discussion of whether or not scrawl-graffiti may be construed as vandalism or art, the aim of the study was to explore whether or not personality factors known to be linked to vandalism in general (such as impulsivity, affectivity, emotional disability, and optimism) are related also to involvement in scrawl-graffiti, and, furthermore, how the gender factor relates to vandalism and scrawl-graffiti, respectively. The analysis showed that impulsiveness was a significant variable related to vandalism as well as to scrawl-graffiti. Further analysis indicated that vandalism was predicted by non-planning impulsiveness whereas scrawl-graffiti was predicted by motor impulsiveness. Analyses showed also that there were significant gender differences related to both vandalism and scrawl-graffiti, whereby male participants were significantly more involved in vandalism than female participants, while the latter were significantly more involved in scrawl-graffiti than the former.

This article suggests that the combined influence of all affective variables may account for the gender differences in mathematical problem solving patterns. © 2007 Shannon Research Press.","2-s2.0-75349083070","Australia"

We show that exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), an integration of CFA and exploratory factor analysis, overcomes these problems in relation to responses to the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) administered to a large Italian community sample. ESEM fitted the data better and resulted in less correlated factors than CFA, although ESEM and CFA factor scores correlated at near unity with observed raw scores. Tests of gender invariance with a 13-model taxonomy of full measurement invariance showed that the factor structure of the BFI is gender-invariant and that women score higher on Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. Through ESEM one could address substantively important issues about BFI psychometric properties that could not be appropriately addressed through traditional approaches. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84954027573","Italy"
"320",2006,"Paedagogica Historica","The historiography of gender and progressive education in the United States","This article examines the feminist historiography of the progressive education movement over the past 25 years using the Foucauldian conception of genealogy and the theoretical approach of critical feminism. Gender has largely been ignored as a significant category of historical analysis in the historiography of progressive education in the United States. The defining history of progressive education in the United States is still Lawrence Cremin's 1961 work, The Transformation of the School. For Cremin, gender is not a significant question. Later historians of the progressive education movement have tended to follow Cremin's approach and have failed to address the gendered nature of progressive ideas of citizenship and democratic education. Early responses to this historiographic tradition by feminist historians of education influenced by the women's movement sought to rescue and celebrate the women of the progressive education movement. They followed what might be called the 'women's recovery project'. This body of work has made an important contribution in uncovering the contributions of women educators but in many cases these studies have taken an uncritical and even romantic approach to their subjects. Moreover, they have tended to replicate a kind of individualistic biographical history, focusing on the achievements of individual women and ignoring the ways in which male/female binaries have worked to create difference and gendered structures of power. Although there are some significant exceptions to this feminist approach, much feminist history of education has failed to consider this process of difference-making or to challenge an empiricist model of history. This article examines the way historians have examined gender in the progressive education movement by looking at two areas: the role of gender in John Dewey's life and work and the lives and work of progressive women school leaders. It argues that gender difference, like race and other subject positions, should not be understood as referring to fixed categories and unchanging reality, but as reflecting the work of difference-making. This entails looking not only at how difference is constructed in the institutional practices of the state and the legal system, but also how it is called forth in the scholarly interpretation of the past. The article suggests that historians of education need to go beyond the recovery project of writing the stories of those who have been 'hidden from history', in Sheila Rowbotham's words, to an analysis of the process of gendering - in the educational sites we study and in the writing of history as an intellectual enterprise.","2-s2.0-35148835063","K."

In general, the results agree with the literature indicating that women tend to be more altruistic, empathetic, and moral than men. Paradoxically, the findings indicate that, within a social media context, emotions related to altruism, empathy toward the cause, and socially oriented moral identity are factors more closely predictive of males’ inclinations to engage in activities to support charitable events. Whereas women are already more predisposed to helping others, nonprofit marketers must emotionally prod men to help others through specific emotional hooks for prosocial behaviors. © , Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84918524694","Germany"

The paper also portrays men and women's varying perceptions regarding these barriers. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 129 participants at a Lebanese university took part in the study. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS. Frequencies and ?2-tests were conducted. Findings: The findings suggest that women are more likely to be discriminated against and are thus more likely to be underrepresented in top leadership positions. Organizational and cultural barriers were considered to cause this discrimination. Women were more likely than men to believe that women face more barriers while climbing the career ladder. Men were more likely than women to believe that organizations are the parties responsible for this underrepresentation, more so than the surrounding culture. Surprisingly, a sound proportion of women believed that men are more competent at occupying top management positions in Lebanon. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies to explore Lebanese perceptions on the workplace's glass ceiling. Further, it examines the differences in opinions between males and females on women in the workplace, which has not been previously studied. This research contributes further to the existing body of knowledge on women in management in Lebanon and the Middle Eastern region, which is generally small in quantity. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-84947051542","Lebanon"

In the context of a continuing lack of representation of (older) women-loving women, viewers of all ages describe a transformative experience, with an emphasis on positive mental health outcomes – yet older women also orient to something implicitly problematic about this being the case. This is premised, I suggest, in the foregrounding of youth and adolescence in academic and public discussions of the role of the media in sexual self-realisation.

Participants (N = 587) were assessed on the Big Five by their teachers when the participants were between 6 and 12 years old. In middle-age (late 40s), the participants reported their occupation. Holland's (1997) RIASEC vocational types (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) were used to characterize the job environments of reported occupations. Childhood Openness/Intellect and Conscientiousness, but no other Big Five traits, were associated with occupational environments. For the most strongly sex-typed work environments, associations with Openness/Intellect were moderated by gender. These findings suggest that the roots of the strongest gender-stereotyping effects in occupations may be found not only in the social factors associated with gender but also in the individual differences of children related to Openness/Intellect. © 2010 American Psychological Association.","2-s2.0-78049483450","United States"
"328",2018,"Social Science and Medicine","How do gender relations affect the working lives of close to community health service providers? Empirical research, a review and conceptual framework","Close-to-community (CTC) providers have been identified as a key cadre to progress universal health coverage and address inequities in health service provision due to their embedded position within communities. CTC providers both work within, and are subject to, the gender norms at community level but may also have the potential to alter them. This paper synthesises current evidence on gender and CTC providers and the services they deliver. This study uses a two-stage exploratory approach drawing upon qualitative research from the six countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique) that were part of the REACHOUT consortium. This research took place from 2013 to 2014. This was followed by systematic review that took place from January–September 2017, using critical interpretive synthesis methodology. This review included 58 papers from the literature. The resulting findings from both stages informed the development of a conceptual framework. We present the holistic conceptual framework to show how gender roles and relations shape CTC provider experience at the individual, community, and health system levels. The evidence presented highlights the importance of safety and mobility at the community level. At the individual level, influence of family and intra-household dynamics are of importance. Important at the health systems level, are career progression and remuneration. We present suggestions for how the role of a CTC provider can, with the right support, be an empowering experience. Key priorities for policymakers to promote gender equity in this cadre include: safety and well-being, remuneration, and career progression opportunities. Gender roles and relations shape CTC provider experiences across multiple levels of the health system. To strengthen the equity and efficiency of CTC programmes gender dynamics should be considered by policymakers and implementers during both the conceptualisation and implementation of CTC programmes. © 2018","2-s2.0-85046875235","United Kingdom"

Yet, there is a paucity of research examining which informal science experiences may encourage women’s interest in STEM careers. This study of female, first semester freshmen, (n = 7,417) uses data from the OPSCI survey to examine the degree to which participation in informal science experiences during high school is associated with undergraduates’ likelihood to pursue STEM careers. A general indicator of STEM OST engagement, specific activities and the number of years during high school in which students engage in these activities are examined. Our analysis, based on descriptive statistics, correlations, and logistic regression models, shows that participation in informal science during high school boosts females’ likelihood of STEM career interest as entering undergraduates, with a higher odds of attracting females without an initial STEM interest. Furthermore, analyses indicate that the odds of a woman being interested in STEM upon entering college is greater for those who had long term participation (for two or more years during high school) in the majority of OST STEM activities, than for those who did not. © 2018, Begell House Inc.","2-s2.0-85041812064","United States"

One hundred and fifty college students from a Serbian university (MAge = 21.58, SD = 2.199) completed a questionnaire measuring homophobia and two months later, they watched the film The Parade (2011) and their appreciation and perception of the film’s quality were assessed along with the level of their homophobia. Statistical analysis that was carried out revealed three relevant findings. First, higher levels of homophobia correlate with less positive evaluations and appreciation of the film. Second, the results show that a greater degree of film appreciation correlates with a decrease in individual’s homophobia level, and last, the analysis reveals that gender of the audience members is not a determining factor when it comes to appreciation or evaluation of the film.

"332",2008,"Journal of International Women's Studies","'The darkness is the closet in which your lover roosts her heart': Lesbians, desire and the gothic genre","This paper discusses the use of the Gothic genre in two 'lesbian' novels; Nightwood by Djuna Barnes (1936) and Affinity by Sarah Waters (1999). The Gothic, I argue, is employed and manipulated in order to counter the repressive effects of 'lesbian panic', evident in much women's fiction (an idea posited by Patricia Smith in Lesbian Panic, 1997). I begin by constructing a framework for my argument from the disparate yet related scholarship of several theorists, including Terry Castle, Eve Sedgwick, Claude Lévi-Strauss and Gayle Rubin. My argument hinges on the claim that lesbianism threatens cultural order - based upon male homosocial relationships and the reciprocal exchange of women - in a similar way to incest. Therefore, lesbianism is subject to extreme repression, rendered shady and invisible in history and literature. Following this theoretical introduction, I argue that the Gothic genre - that twilight realm of unconscious fantasies and forbidden desires - can be used as a tool for subverting the repressive system that keeps lesbianism in its place, bringing its silence into articulation. Through the self-conscious use of Gothic tropes in Nightwood and Affinity, Djuna Barnes and Sarah Waters write the lesbian back into tangible existence, 'repossessing' the spectre of the lesbian towards their own emancipating ends. In particular, the incest taboo and the love triangle are twisted into new shapes in these novels, so that all that Western culture designates as 'abject' becomes eerily illuminated by the Gothic's unflinching perspective. Finally, I discuss the options available when concluding a lesbian novel and the effects of genre on narrative outcome: Is a happy ending possible in a realist lesbian novel? Could the Gothic genre hold the key to unravelling the silence of lesbian panic? My conclusion leaves discussion open to other perspectives, arguments, and, of course, to further scholarship.","2-s2.0-43349106998","United Kingdom"

Six systematic reviews provide the most up to date evidence base on research surrounding children and HIV on key topics of treatment resistance and adherence, schooling, nutrition, cognitive development and orphaning and bereavement. Traditional systematic review techniques were used to identify all published studies on four key topics, then studies were selected according to adequacy criteria (sufficient size, control group and adequate measures). A gender analysis was performed on included studies, detailing whether gender was measured, results were analysed by gender or any gender-based findings. For family studies, both the gender of the parents and gender of the child are needed. Secondary analysis by gender was performed on existing systematic reviews for treatment resistance and adherence. Of the 12 studies on treatment resistance, 11 did not look at gender. One found boys at a seven-fold risk compared to girls. For medication adherence, gender was not significant. Of the 15 studies on schooling, 12 analysed findings by gender with an overall female disadvantage. Of the 14 studies on nutrition, nine analysed by gender with mixed findings. Of the 54 studies on cognitive development, 17 provided gender data, but only four analysed by gender with few differences established. Of the 15 studies on bereavement, seven analysed data by gender again with mixed findings. Major policies fail to provide gender data for young children. WHO, UNAIDS and the international data sets are not gathered or coded by gender for young children (generally under 15 years of age) despite well-established gender challenges in later life. This review shows that the current evidence base is inadequate.

Using data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project (WiscAds) of all ad-airings (not merely ads created) in the top 75 to 100 media markets in 2000 and 2002, we find that campaigns stepped up issues relevant to 9/11 consistent with party- and gender-based issue ownership.

Going beyond what has been discovered in a previous study that women’s involvement in patenting is lower than their male peers in nanotechnology, the empirical evidence reported here suggests that the gap to women’s disadvantage was smaller in nanotechnology than in the overall tech area in the studied period. The major finding of this study is that, while more than 90% of patents across fields were from industry where patenting is least likely to be collaborative, nano-patents have more diverse origins (79% from industry and 21 from universities, government, public institutions, and cross-sectoral collaboration) and are more likely to be collaborative outcomes (including those from industry). The profile of nanotechnology patents in terms of workforce sectors has the implication that nanotechnology presents an environment where women are more able to catch collaborative opportunities and engage in patenting. Implications for future research are discussed correspondingly. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","2-s2.0-85037664639","China"

The debate, on whether there is difference between subordinates' self-ratings of their performance, and superiors' ratings of it is better, continues. This is because the extant literature is inconclusive. This study contributes towards resolution of the debate at least for the hotel industry in Australia. The study examined (a) if there is a difference between the superiors' ratings, and subordinates' self-ratings, of subordinates' performance, and (b) if subordinates' gender would explain the difference (if any) found under (a) in the hotel industry. In total, a usable response of 66 general managers (the superiors) and 66 rooms and 66 food and beverage managers (the subordinates) from 66 hotels and resorts were received. The results of the study revealed significant differences between (i) the general managers' (GMs') ratings of their department managers' (DMs') performance and (ii) the DMs' self-ratings of their performance.

However, the BPfA's critique of media and communication systems was conceptually limited and its agenda for action was politically conservative. Twenty years after Beijing, progress has been slow and in some respects has stalled. Meanwhile the media landscape has been transformed through digitalisation, the lines have blurred between media companies and technology firms, and the power of the media and communication sector has grown enormously. Politicians, policy makers and international institutions have become timid in their dealings with media institutions, and attempts to promote change have been diluted in multi-stakeholder initiatives that tend to privilege the private sector over civil society organisations. Almost two decades into the 21st century, it is time to revisit the BPfA's conceptualisation of the media and communication in the context of the digital media age, and to restore focus on the political economy that sustains unequal gender and power relations through today's many mediated spaces.","2-s2.0-85029125215","United Kingdom"

It demonstrates that this space provides the grounds for migrants to develop 'deviant heterosexuality', such as extramarital relationships while simultaneously causing dilemmas and contestation of gender dynamics in conjugal and familial relationships. Drawing on ethnographic research and in-depth interviews, I elucidate the extramarital relationships among migrant Filipino workers in South Korea. By incorporating discussions of 'queer heterosexualities' and Hubbard's geographical engagement of sexuality into analysis, I argue that migrants' extramarital practices are shaped not only by dominant discourse, but also through the particular social and spatial positioning of individuals. First, I demonstrate that the liminal space gives migrant Filipino workers a certain degree of autonomy from the power and ideological interventions of both sending and host societies. Second, I highlight the liminal space that is extended by migrants themselves, especially through the increasing economic ability and mobility of migrant women, which can reconfigure the modes of heteronormativity and gender structure in conjugal, familial and extramarital relationships. In the end, I argue that transnational migration results not only in provisional liminality but also prolonged liminality through migrants' initiative in pursuing their desired heterosexuality and their endeavour to convert extramarital relationships into long-term intimacy.

B. and C. versus Ireland: A new beginning to access legal abortion in the Republic of Ireland?","This article analyses some possible political implications of the case and the decision in A. B. and C. v. Ireland at the European Court of Human Rights. This case was heard in a public hearing on 9 December 2009; the judgment was provided in December 2010. I argue that the three applicants in this case employed a novel strategy, not previously considered, to access legal abortion in the Republic of Ireland. By highlighting the varied circumstances of unintended pregnancy in more than a single instance, the applicants utilized an offensive manoeuvre to which the government is unlikely to respond consistently over time. They exposed Irish governments' use of clandestine political negotiations in relation to European treaties, the questionable exertion of governments' authority to uphold political and moral agendas and racialized constructions of Irishness and national interests. The applicants also raised serious questions about state practices in the Republic of Ireland in relation to its legal obligation to uphold human rights under the European Convention. However, I argue that it is unlikely that this novel strategy and legal decision and their political implications are enough to adequately address the lack of access to legal abortion in the Republic of Ireland. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-80054853258","Canada"

Ethnographic evidence from rural South India","Ethnographic research was conducted in rural communities in Karnataka State, South India, to explore the contexts in which marital violence occurs and the relationships between structural inequalities (gender, caste, and class inequalities) and marital violence. Research highlighted that (a) marital violence is intimately linked to experiences of gender, caste, and class inequalities; (b) women's ability to resist violence hinges on access to economic and social resources; and (c) health care providers need to be actively involved in responding to violence. This study demonstrates the urgent need for violence prevention initiatives, particularly those that address the contribution of structural inequalities. © 2005 Sage Publications.","2-s2.0-20744442702","United States"
"347",2016,"Gender and Language","Visual silence and non-normative sexualities: Art, transduction and performance","Marginalisation of people in non-hegemonic/non-normative gender roles and sexualities is often discussed in terms of their 'silencing'. Silence tends to occupy liminal stages of communication and interaction, it is well suited to indexing marginalised subjectivities. However, this paper argues that in the context of artistic performance, that is where silence is displayed rather than imposed, it can be revalued as affirming and liberating. Art, which thrives on equivocality and understatement, tends to be silence-friendly due to its affordances of relative indeterminacy and ambiguity. Several examples of transduction of silence in modern and contemporary art illustrate how art embraces, rather than obscures or disavows, male and female homosexual identities and non-heroic masculinities. The works examined include Robert Rauschenberg's and Agnes Martin's monochromes, New York Dada drawings and photographs, and activist HIV/AIDS installations and photographs. © 2016, equinox publishing.","2-s2.0-85009909989","Hong Kong"
"348",2016,"Management Science","Matching platforms and HIV incidence: An empirical investigation of race, gender, and socioeconomic status","Although recent work has examined the adverse implications of Internet-enabled matching platforms, limited attention has been paid to whom the negative externalities accrue. We examine how the entry of platforms for the solicitation of casual sex influences the incidence rate of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection by race, gender, and socioeconomic status. Using a census of 12 million patients subjected to a natural experiment in Florida, we find a significant increase in HIV incidence after platform implementation, with the largest effect accruing to historically at-risk populations (i.e., African Americans) despite documented lower rates of Internet utilization. Strikingly, our analysis reveals that HIV incidence increases in historically low-risk populations as well (e.g., individuals of higher socioeconomic status) and that men and women experience similar penalties. Identifying granular effects across subpopulations allows us to offer additional insight into the mechanisms by which matching platforms increase HIV incidence. We estimate the cumulative effect of platform entry over the five-year period of the study as 1,149 additional Floridians contracting HIV at a cost of $710 million. © 2016 INFORMS.","2-s2.0-84983048094","United States"
"349",2017,"Feminist Economics","Between Visibility and Invisibility: Sex Workers and Informal Services in Amsterdam","This study examines informal services within the sex industry in the Red Light District of Amsterdam, the Netherlands and how these affect the autonomy of sex workers. Data were obtained from the police files of twelve criminal investigations into human trafficking in Amsterdam between 2006 and 2010. The empirical data show that sex workers are intermeshed in a network of people who intercede with them and their work: pimps, bodyguards, errand boys, drivers, brothel owners, and accountants. While these informal players offer services to facilitate sex work, they simultaneously create a network of control around the sex workers and profit from the latters’ earnings. The existence of this informal network and its activities both supports sex workers, but also undermines the autonomy of self-employed sex workers in the studied cases. © 2016 IAFFE.","2-s2.0-84979279896","Netherlands"

Methods: The National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) (1990-1992) yielded lifetime risks of psychiatric disorders in a probability sample of 8098 respondents in the 48 contiguous states using DSM-III-R for diagnosis. Logistic regressions of alcohol and drug disorders were performed to compare their correlates in rural, urban, and metropolitan areas after stratifying by demographic and socioeconomic variables. Results: Household income was protective only in rural areas. High occupation strata were positively associated with alcohol disorders. Urban and metropolitan women were less likely to report drug disorders. There was no gender difference in rural drug abuse and dependence. Also, high occupation strata were positively associated with drug disorders. Conclusion: Lack of gender differences in rural drug disorders may indicate an increase in drug availability, access, and use among rural women. Workplace alcohol and drug disorders, especially among metropolitan sales, crafts, and service workers should be of concern to policymakers. These results underline the usefulness of using multiple indicators of socioeconomic positions in epidemiologic studies of substance use disorders.","2-s2.0-2942659215","United States"
"351",2011,"Sex Roles","Gender Conceptualizations in Female High School Seniors: Relationships with Global Self-Worth and Multiple Measures of Body Image","This study was conducted to determine if gender-role conceptualizations in adolescent girls were related to their global self-worth and several dimensions of their body image. Self-report surveys were administered to 335 predominantly Caucasian Grade 12 girls from religiously-based high schools in the midwestern part of the United States. It was hypothesized that adolescent females' gender-typing of themselves as well as their gender-related attitudes towards others would be significantly, and possibly divergently, related to their perceptions of themselves and their physical bodies. Obtained data were analyzed using multivariate canonical correlation procedures. The results of these analyses revealed support for the predicted overall relationship between gender conceptualizations and self-perceptions, but also indicated some differences in the way in which the two dimensions of gender-role conceptualizations (personal and attitudes towards others) were associated with adolescents' perceptions of themselves. Specifically, girls exhibiting more egalitarian gender-related attitudes towards others scored higher on global self-worth and lower in body appearance orientation. In addition, higher self-endorsement on the masculine subscales was linked with higher global self-worth, lower social physique anxiety, and higher use of competence to evaluate the physical body. In contrast, high self-endorsement on the feminine subscales exhibited mixed links to the set of self-perceptual variables. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-79960975751","United States"

Among schools with poor water access during the dry season, those that received a water supply, hygiene promotion and water treatment (HP&WT) and sanitation improvement demonstrated increased enrolment (ß = 0.091 [0.009, 0.173] p = 0.03), which translates to 26 additional pupils per school on average. The proportion of girls enrolled in school also increased by 4% (prevalence ratio (PR) = 1.04 [1.00, 1.07] p = 0.02). Among schools with better baseline water access during the dry season (schools that did not receive a water source), we found no evidence of increased enrolment in schools that received a HP&WT intervention (ß = 0.016 [-0.039, 0.072] p = 0.56) or the HP&WT and sanitation intervention (ß = 0.027 [-0.028, 0.082] p = 0.34), and there was no evidence of improved gender parity (PR = 0.99 [0.96, 1.02] p = 0.59, PR = 1.00 [0.97, 1.02] p = 0.75, respectively). Our findings suggest that increased school enrolment and improved gender parity may be influenced by a comprehensive WASH programme that includes an improved water source; schools with poor water access during the dry season may benefit most from these interventions. © IWA Publishing 2013.","2-s2.0-84886022186","United States"

Method: From 2,404 children aged 6 to 13 years, 225 boys and 99 girls with ADHD symptoms were identified using the parent version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children and compared on parent reports of children's behavioral problems and impairment. Results: When ADHD types were collapsed into a single group, boys and girls did not differ on core symptoms, comorbidity, and impairment with the exception that girls rated higher on somatic complaints and boys had poorer school functioning. However, gender patterns were found to vary across ADHD type on impairment measures of social problems, schoolwork difficulties, and self-esteem, with boys being generally rated as more impaired in the combined and hyperactive-impulsive groups but equally or less impaired in the inattentive group. Conclusions: The findings suggest the possibility of gender-specific risks associated with high levels of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms indicating that ADHD subtype membership should be considered when conducting ADHD gender comparisons.","2-s2.0-13244266920","Australia"

The article will (i) detail the legal background to these cases, (ii) offer a critique of the claims that non-disclosure of gender history serves to vitiate consent, constitute harm and provide evidence of deception, and (iii) provide three arguments as to why criminalisation is inappropriate in any event. The arguments against criminalisation that will be advanced are that prosecution (i) produces legal inconsistency and is potentially discriminatory, (ii) unduly valorises the sexual autonomy of cisgender people, and (iii) is contrary to good public policy. In developing these arguments, the article will highlight how the ‘intelligibility’ of prosecution proceeds from a prior cisnormative framing of events. © 2015 Norwegian Centre for Human Rights.","2-s2.0-85012891094","Australia"
"355",2014,"Journal of African American Studies","Exposure to Prison Sexual Assault among Incarcerated Black Men","Despite the enactment of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA), human rights abuses involving sexual assaults abound in US prisons. Exposure to these assaults may contribute to posttraumatic stress and antisocial behavior among incarcerated Black men, because their rates of incarceration are disproportionately high. However, research on exposure to sexual assault in US prisons is limited. An anonymous self-report questionnaire on prison sexual assault exposure was administered to 134 randomly selected incarcerated Black men. Forty-three percent reported hearing sexual assaults occurring within the facility and 16 % visually witnessed them. Sexual orientation was associated with witnessing sexual assault (<U+03C7>2 = 3.68, df = 1, p < 0.05). Findings from this study suggest that sexual assaults may be common in US prisons despite the PREA directive to eliminate such incidents. Conventional violence prevention programs and interventions may not meet the unique needs of prison populations given the high exposure to sexually coercive behaviors reported. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84899522923","United States"

"357",2004,"International Journal of Lifelong Education","Through a gender lens: Explaining north-eastern thai women’s participation in adult literacy education","This ethnographic study employs a gender perspective to understand the motivations of eight women literacy learners participating in a village-based functional literacy programme in rural North-eastern Thailand. Field research took place over six months of periodic residence in a North-eastern Thai village, and involved participant observation, individual interviews and informal focus groups. An analysis of the women’s reproductive, productive and community roles, and their practical and strategic gender needs (Moser 1993) is used to frame findings on the women’s participation in the literacy programme. In brief, although the women valued educational programmes that reduced the burden of their reproductive labour, offered income-generating opportunities in their productive roles and supported their leadership roles in the community, the village literacy programme had limited effect in addressing these practical gender needs. However, because a patriarchal ideology and Buddhist institutions had denied the women access to schooling as children, they now saw the literacy programme as both a symbolic return to school and a collective women’s space to advocate for more desirable adult educational programmes. In these ways, the programme addressed their strategic gender needs. The study argues that a gender lens is critical in explaining women’s participation in literacy programmes and in designing literacy education for development. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84982983779","Canada"
"358",2009,"Adolescence","Anger as a predictor of suicidal ideation in middle-school students in Korea: Gender difference in threshold point","Studies on gender differences in suicidal ideation and anger are limited. Furthermore, these studies focused on linear relationships, which limits the full understanding of the complex relationships and hampers identification of highrisk groups for suicidal tendencies. Hence, this study aims to assess the gender differences in: (1) the level of suicidal ideation and anger; (2) predictors for suicidal ideation; and (3) the varying association between suicidal ideation and anger. The target population for this cross-sectional, correlational study was adolescents aged 13 to 15 years living in South Korea. A total of 258 adolescents (160 boys and 98 girls) completed the Multi-dimensional Anger Inventory and Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, multiple linear, and spline regression analysis. Girls reported significantly higher scores in both anger and suicidal ideation. While anger was a significant predictor for suicidal ideation only in boys, both school life satisfaction and anger were significant predictors of suicidal ideation in girls. After controlling for sociodemographic factors, the spline regression revealed a significant threshold point in the relationship between anger and suicidal ideation, particularly among girls. At the threshold anger point of 117.67, 12.5% of girls belonged to the high-risk group. The gender-specific patterns of the relationship between suicidal ideation and anger and the existence of threshold points confirmed the need for targeted suicidal preventive programs focusing on controlling anger.","2-s2.0-77950748870","South Korea"

Sixty-four adolescents completed ratings of family enmeshment, perceived distress tolerance, an interpersonal challenge task, and mood ratings before and immediately after the task. Before and during the challenge task, adolescents' respiratory sinus arrhythmia (an indicator of cardiac vagal tone) was recorded. Associations were tested between adolescents' perceptions of family enmeshment and 3 aspects of adolescent emotional dysregulation. Adolescents who perceived higher family enmeshment also demonstrated greater emotional dysregulation in several domains: negative global appraisals of distress tolerance, stronger increase in subjective negative mood from baseline to postchallenge, lower baseline vagal tone, and vagal augmentation during the challenge task. Gender differences also emerged, such that girls reported more negative distress appraisals overall and enmeshed boys showed greater emotional dysregulation across analyses.

"362",2019,"Social Psychology of Education","The interest gap: how gender stereotype endorsement about abilities predicts differences in academic interests","This study used a novel approach to examine the link between gender ability stereotype endorsement and academic interests by examining not only stereotypes people hold within the domains of mathematics and language arts, but also between them. Grade 6 and 8 students (285 males, 363 females) reported their degree of stereotype endorsement and interest in these two academic domains. Results of path analyses revealed that stereotype endorsement within and between domains accounted for gender differences in interest. In language arts, endorsing a stereotype that females are more competent than males predicted subsequent interest in the domain and accounted for the greater language arts interest among females. In mathematics, however, the perception that males are more competent in mathematics relative to language arts was linked to students’ interest in this domain and accounted for the interest gap between genders. These results suggest that students’ interests relate to endorsed stereotypes that are either driven by a perceived gender superiority within one domain—when females are viewed as more competent than males in language arts—or a gender superiority between two domains—when males are viewed as more competent in mathematics relative to language arts. Considering not only stereotypes favoring a gender within one domain, but also between domains, provides a more accurate portrait of students’ actual stereotypes and can be useful to better understanding how the interest gap emerges. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85057086698","Canada"

In addition, we examined nomological validity via basic psychological needs satisfaction. Participants totaled 1,812 Portuguese athletes (1,220 males and 592 females; aged 15–59 years, Mage = 17.72, SD = 5.51) from football (n = 596), basketball (n = 273), swimming (n = 800), and parasport (n = 143). The BRSQ measurement model was invariant across gender and these four sports. The scale confirmed nomological validity in that satisfaction of basic psychological needs positively predicted autonomous forms of motivation and negatively predicted more controlled motivation and amotivation as suggested by self-determination theory. In light of this evidence for BRSQ construct validity, composite reliability, nomological validity, and invariance across gender and four different sports, this scale is a useful tool for coaches of the aforementioned sports in their efforts to evaluate their athletes' motivation. © The Author(s) 2019.","2-s2.0-85061047735","Portugal"

Multiple regression is especially beneficial where it provides information on strength of association, specific dollar estimates, and the option to identify outliers by gender. Resampling simulation allows for analysis at the department level and is beneficial where distributions depart substantially from normal, particularly where there are unequal error variances. Results indicate that both regression and simulation methods provided evidence of a sizable pay gap associated with gender, even after controlling for rank, academic field, and years of service. The gap occurs in fields traditionally viewed as female as well as science fields with typically lower female representation.

The article demonstrates that the three groups of mothers defined by these two variables differ on a variety of attitudes concerning whom the child resembles, the influence of genes, the position of the sperm donor, and reflections on the experience of motherhood. The gestational mothers in heterosexual partnerships experience contradictions in denying the influence of the donor and expressing interest in him. They view the children as resembling themselves more than either the donor or their partners. The gestational mothers in lesbian partnerships both deny the influence of the donor and express disinterest in him. Like the gestational mothers in heterosexual partnerships, they also see the children as resembling themselves more than either the donor or their partners. The nongestational mothers in lesbian partnerships offer an alternative form of mothering within the family in the form of collaborative influence on the child.

To highlight the major impact that CIGAD has had in educating and empowering Caribbean men and women, the authors will first discuss the importance of feminist pedagogies in teaching, learning and activism in this programme by locating them within an intersectional postcolonial/transnational framework. Secondly, the authors consider the ways in which feminist pedagogy and praxis have been central in training women and men in the Caribbean region in gender analysis, helping them recognise the important role gender plays in development planning and policy as well as how it can be integrated into their work to improve their communities. Finally, through a feminist dialogic, participatory and experiential approach, the authors assess the impact that the CIGAD has had on participants, and community development training will be discussed based on the monitoring and evaluation of the exercise completed in 2014. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-84961390159","Canada"

A rural secondary school in Victoria, Australia established an alternative education programme to cater for local disengaged young people. A critical ethnographic study was conducted over 12 months, comprising observation of the programme, and involving interviews with 12 key personnel. Findings revealed the ways in which young people were positioned within the secondary school, alternative programme and community contributed to a response within the alternative programme which was based upon a therapeutic ethos, focusing on perceived social and emotional deficits. In the light of findings, it is argued that there is a need to construct alternative spaces that work to not only re-engage them with learning, but also to counter the stigma many of these young people face in their schooling and in the local community. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-84981165840","Australia"
"369",2019,"Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences","Gender and the senses of agency","This paper details the ways that gender structures our senses of agency on an enactive framework. While it is common to discuss how gender influences higher, narrative levels of cognition, as with the formulation of goals and in considerations about our identities, it is less clear how gender structures our more immediate, embodied processes, such as the minimal sense of agency. While enactivists often acknowledge that gender and other aspects of our socio-cultural situatedness shape our cognitive processes, there is little work on how this shaping takes place. In order to provide such an account, I will first look at the minimal and narrative senses of agency (Gallagher in New Ideas in Psychology, 30(1), 15–31, 2012), a distinction that draws from work on minimal and narrative selves (Zahavi 2010). Next I will explain the influence of the narrative sense of agency on the minimal sense of agency through work on intention-formation (Pacherie in Psyche, 13(1), 1–30, 2007). After a discussion of the role of gender in the narrative sense of agency, I’ll expand on work by Haslanger (2012) and Young (1990) to offer three ways in which gender influences the minimal sense of agency, showing the effect that gender has on how we perceive our possibilities for interaction in a phenomenologically immediate, pre-reflective manner. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","2-s2.0-85048797291","Australia"

However, there is much less research on self-initiated expatriates (SIE), who themselves have decided to expatriate to work abroad. The purpose of this paper is to provide knowledge on this under-researched group of expatriates. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire was directed electronically towards SIE academics in universities in the Nordic countries and in The Netherlands. Findings - The current study examines marital status, gender and work outcomes of SIEs, and specifically whether there is a moderating effect of gender. Results showed, as expected, a positive association between being married and work effectiveness as well as with work performance but, surprisingly, there was no moderating effect of gender on these positive relationships. Practical implications - Results indicate that organizations recruiting SIEs in the host country location may want to prefer married expatriates over their unmarried counterparts in the anticipation for them to achieve better work outcomes. However, there should be no distinguishing between men or women in the recruitment process.

These alternative imaginings are articulated in two artworks, 'Home', by Mary McIntyre, and 'Street Signs', by Aisling O'Beirn. I present readings of these pieces with reference to concepts of public and private which signify through socio-political, geographical and psychological orderings of space. Focusing on the construction of public and private space allows me to approach the issue of sectarian territorialisation in Belfast obliquely, while recognising its physical and psychological potency and the complexity of its operations; further, it facilitates the exploration of how gender and memory are made to matter spatially, in general and specifically in Belfast. This analytical perspective clarifies certain exclusions and oppressions inherent in the framing of space, but also offers understandings of how these may be destabilised, allowing unorthodox or marginal identities and practices to emerge as co-constituents of space.","2-s2.0-51449117616","Ireland"

The Marital Impact Checklist is used to assess the effects of ADHD on marriage. The Gender Roles Attitude Scale is used to measure gender roles in both the patient and the spouse. Results: The Turkish version of the Marital Impact Checklist is found to have good internal consistency and utility in research and clinical work with ADHD couples. The female non-ADHD partners reported feeling of “Unloved” and “Negative Impact” more than their male counterparts. Some subdomains of the gender roles of both the patient and their non-ADHD spouse seem to mediate the effect of adult ADHD’s impact on marriage. Conclusion: Sex and gender roles diversify how ADHD affects marriage. © The Author(s) 2015.","2-s2.0-85015598930","Turkey"
"374",2011,"Journal of Couple and Relationship Therapy","Materialism and marriage: Couple profiles of congruent and incongruent spouses","Previous research has shown that spousal materialism is negatively associated with marital satisfaction. However, researchers have yet to determine if this association is due to value differences between spouses or if materialism is problematic even when partners place a similar priority on money and material goods. Using 1,734 married couples, we developed a typology of couple materialism to investigate how congruent and incongruent patterns of materialism between spouses influence marital outcomes. We found that materialism had a negative association with marital quality, even when spouses were unified in their materialistic values. Marriages in which both spouses reported low materialism were better off on several features of marital quality when compared to couples where one or both spouses reported high materialism. Implications are drawn for therapists and financial counselors working with couples dealing with financial strain or conflict related to economic issues. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-80053466768","United States"

It analyses gender ideology and expectations among women and the shared investment in the moral identity attached to being a good Gypsy-Traveller wife. The paper argues that 'Gypsy-Traveller woman' cannot be understood as an identity that stands apart from gender and racial oppression. It is within this context that the tension between change and permanence in gender relations is played out. It argues that the maintenance of cultural taboos embodied and symbolised in the surveillance of womens' bodies is an important issue that problematises the construction of Gypsy-Traveller women. It posits that the appeal to morality may represent as much an avoidance of anxiety as a defence of marked gendered divisions within Gypsy-Traveller society. The paper suggests that the demands of cultural survival play a significant role in framing the degree to which women are willing or able to challenge the status quo. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84904394712","United Kingdom"

The way in which adolescents perceive themselves along these dimensions affects the quality of their relationships across multiple social contexts. Given the centrality of morality, competence, and sociability for adolescents’ social life, the purpose of this study was to understand how these dimensions develop over time with a focus on gender differences, since males and females can show distinct trajectories due to socialization and developmental processes. Participants were 916 (51.4% girls; M age = 15.64 years) adolescents involved in a three-wave longitudinal study with annual assessments. The findings highlighted that females reported increasing levels of morality and competence, while males showed decreasing levels in all dimensions. Furthermore, females also showed greater consistency in the configuration of morality, competence, and sociability, and inter-individual differences appeared to be already well-settled in each dimension for both males and females. Overall, this study increases the developmental understanding of how core dimensions of social judgment change in the adolescent phase, highlighting gender differences and similarities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85061736968","Italy"

The gender dimension to remittance behavior is not an issue that has featured strongly in the existing literature and our findings thus contain novel appeal. In addition, we use estimates from both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic tobit models to decompose the observed gender differences in remittances into treatment and endowment components. The paper finds little evidence that gender differences in remittances are attributable to behavioral differences between men and women. Instead, the empirical results show that endowment differences, such as gender differences in household head status and labor market earnings, are more important in explaining the overall gender difference in the remittance level. © 2008 by Asian Development Bank.","2-s2.0-77949379911","United Kingdom"

It poses two research questions: the first centres on how far work<U+E4F8>life balance policies have better enabled working parents to manage their commitments to employers and children, whilst the second focuses on how far parental and employer responses to work<U+E4F8>life balance policies may be gendered. The ultimate aim is to (re)<U+E4F8>articulate the importance of gender in the work<U+E4F8>life balance agenda. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws upon historical and conceptual research on work and family practices. It invokes gender as a lens through which notions of the “well<U+E4F8>balanced family” are considered. Findings – It is argued that work<U+E4F8>life balance policies have not led to well<U+E4F8>balanced, or “gender<U+E4F8>neutral”, work and family practices. This is for two reasons, both relating to gender. First, the take up of work<U+E4F8>life balance policies is gendered, with more mothers than fathers working flexibly. This is partly because organizational expectations fail to acknowledge social change around the paternal parenting role. Second, work<U+E4F8>life balance policies focus mainly on the issues of paid work and childcare, failing to take account of domestic labour, the main burden of which continues to be carried by mothers. Practical implications – Deeply ingrained social assumptions about the gendered division of labour within heterosexual couples limit the impact of work<U+E4F8>life balance policies on work family practices. Originality/value – The paper moves forward the debate on work<U+E4F8>life balance through taking an interdisciplinary approach to an issue which has often been addressed previously from discipline<U+E4F8>specific approaches such as health, psychology or policy. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-78149249724","United Kingdom"

Findings indicate that cultural gender norms and expectations in the country of origin play a key role. The study shows that women migrants are less likely to remit than men and, when they do, they transfer smaller amounts. The remittance gender gap is not universal among subgroups, since it is only observable among Hispanics who came to the US to improve their economic situation, plan to return to their home country, and have low income and low schooling.

While a politics of difference is indispensable to highlight the differential axes and experiences of oppression, a critical sociological understanding of social relations that make for structural differences and commonalities needs to be built up in order to grapple with a complex and rapidly changing social reality. Drawing from multiple critical perspectives to create a conceptual synthesis and taking a structural approach to ‘difference’, the article develops the contours of a critical feminist sociological framework grounded in theories of production relations and cultural subordination that may be useful to explore the complex and dynamic interconnections between caste, class and patriarchy. It also attempts to understand aspects of caste–class-specific gender relations and patriarchal forms as well as account for key differences and divisions between women. The article argues that by providing a contextualised, interactional understanding of differential social relations and differential social locations of both women and men, feminist sociology can make a new and distinct contribution to the systematic and systemic study of, as well as illuminate more fully, the workings of societal systems of domination–subordination. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.","2-s2.0-84992671970","India"
"385",2013,"International Journal of Psychology","Level of emotional awareness in the general French population: Effects of gender, age, and education level","The Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) developed by Lane et al. (1990) measures the ability of a subject to discriminate his or her own emotional state and that of others. The scale is based on a cognitive-developmental model in which emotional awareness increases in a similar fashion to intellectual functions. Because studies performed using North American and German populations have demonstrated an effect of age, gender, and level of education on the ability to differentiate emotional states, our study attempts to evaluate whether these factors have the same effects in a general French population. 750 volunteers (506 female, 244 male), who were recruited from three regions of France (Lille, Montpellier, Paris), completed the LEAS. The sample was divided into five age groups and three education levels. The results of the LEAS scores for self and others and the total score showed a difference in the level of emotional awareness for different age groups, by gender and education level. A higher emotional level was observed for younger age groups, suggesting that emotional awareness depends on the cultural context and generational societal teachings. Additionally, the level of emotional awareness was higher in women than in men and lower in individuals with less education. This result might be explained by an educational bias linked to gender and higher education whereby expressive ability is reinforced. In addition, given the high degree of variability in previously observed scores in the French population, we propose a standard based on our French sample. © 2013 © 2013 International Union of Psychological Science.","2-s2.0-84890426633","France"

It is set out as alternative the method of triple zipper applied to the closed and blocked lists, and it is shown the effect that this method would had in all the general elections. The triple zipper requires that each party heads the half of its lists with a given gender and the other half with the opposite gender, and in each constituency the half of the parties heads their lists with a gender and the other half with the opposite one.

"387",2018,"Journal of Eastern African Studies","Age and gender voting trends in the 2015 Tanzanian general election","In Tanzania, younger voters have been more inclined to support opposition parties than their elders, who have proven relatively reluctant to look beyond the incumbent party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM). A ‘gender gap’ also exists within Tanzanian politics. Women are more likely to be pro-CCM than men, who are comparatively open to a change of government. Based on qualitative data collected in Tanzania between 2013 and 2015, this article looks to explain these dynamics. Regarding the age-related trend, it argues that young people tend to evaluate CCM less positively than older people due to the difference in their levels of experience of the party’s evolving administrative style. They are also more likely to view the opposition favourably due to higher exposure to their message and a greater reluctance to accept attempts to discredit them. Concerning the gender gap, it contends that women’s generally lower access to information results in their taking a less critical attitude towards CCM. They are also more likely than men to be dissuaded from voting for the opposition due to fear of potential violence. Furthermore, new patterns of political patronage have seen women targeted in CCM’s vote buying exercises. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85036554058","United Kingdom"

However, the impact of sexualization of women victims of subtle forms of gender violence and the moderating role of people’s conservativism on victim blaming remain under-investigated. In the current study, we examined the effects of sexualization on blame attribution to victims of a stranger harassment incident, considering the moderating role of participants’ Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA). Two hundred and thirty-six participants (31.8% male; Mage = 30.52, SD = 12.70) completed an RWA scale and then read a fictitious Facebook’s post where the victim herself described the stranger harassment episode that happened down the street (vs. at a house party). The post was presented with a sexualized (vs. non-sexualized) portrayal of the victim. Finally, participants rated the severity of the episode and expressed to what extent they blamed the victim. As predicted, harassment at the house party (vs. down the street) was perceived as less severe, and sexualized (vs. non-sexualized) victims were blamed to a greater extent. Our major results revealed that people’s RWA synergizes with the victim’s sexualization in shaping blame attribution. People with an average and a high level of RWA tend to blame to a greater extent the sexualized victim of stranger harassment, while blame attributions did not change according to victim’s sexualization for people with a low level of RWA. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","2-s2.0-85061009345","Italy"

Using an ecological approach that links SEER breast cancer mortality data with Census 2000 data, we test the hypothesis of higher breast cancer mortality in areas with more presumed lesbians. From the Census 2000 data on female same-sex partnered households, we derive a measure of sexual minority women density (SMWD) for each of the 215 counties covered by SEER 12. We test the association of SMWD with breast cancer mortality using multivariable Poisson regression models that control for age, race, and socioeconomic status. We confirm our hypothesis as we find a significant positive association between SMWD and breast cancer mortality. This relationship remains significant even after controlling for other factors, known to have an association with mortality, such as poverty or race. This ecological approach compensates for the absence of cancer surveillance by sexual orientation. The results suggest a disparity in breast cancer mortality due to sexual orientation.

It draws on Sen's capability and Weber's ideal-types approach to analyze policies across countries. It offers the ideal parental leave architecture, one which minimizes the policy-generated gender and class inequality in parents’ opportunities to share parenting and keep their jobs, thus providing real opportunities for different groups of individuals to achieve valued functionings as parents. Five policy indicators are created using benchmarking and graphical analysis. Two sources of opportunity inequality are considered: the leave system as the opportunity and constraint structure, and the socio-economic contexts as the conversion factors. The article produces a comprehensive overview of national leave policies, visually presenting leave policy across countries. Considering policy capability ramifications beyond gender challenges a family policy-cluster idea and the Nordic-Baltic divide. It demonstrates that leave systems in northern Europe are far from homogenous; they diverge in the degree to which they create real opportunities for parents and children as well as in key policy dimensions through which these opportunities are created. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2-s2.0-85020201210","Poland"

The study utilized data from parent and teacher reports on 293 US Black-White biracial children enrolled in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Growth curve models suggested increasing trajectories of teacher-reported internalizing and externalizing behaviors between kindergarten and fifth grade. Parents' racial identification of children predicted child externalizing behavior trajectories such that teachers rated biracially identified children's externalizing behaviors lower relative to those of Black- and White-identified children. Additionally, for White-identified biracial children, the effect of family SES on internalizing behavior trajectories was especially pronounced. These findings suggest that in the USA, how parents racially identify their Black-White biracial children early on has important implications for children's problem behaviors throughout the elementary school years. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2-s2.0-84892446417","United States"

Content analysis results ascertained four primary findings with respect to transitional housing facilities for women leaving the sex industry, including their conflation of sex trading with sex trafficking, dominance by Christian faith-based organizations, race-neutral approach, and depiction of their clients as uneducated and socially isolated. Yet our statistical analysis revealed that significant differences exist between women’s sex industry experiences in ways that are strongly determined by ethno-racial identity, age, marital status, and exposure to abuse throughout the life course. Juxtaposing the results of these analyses highlights some rather glaring disconnects between the ways that facility websites depict their clients and the meaningful differences between women seeking services at the Denver transitional housing facility. These findings raise significant concerns regarding approaches that ignore ethno-racial differences, collapse the sex industry’s complexity, make assumptions about the women’s educational or other needs, and neglect the importance of women’s community and relational ties. Taken together, these troubling realities suggest a need for evidenced-based, rather than ideology-based, alternatives for women who wish to leave the sex industry. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84982126119","United States"

The main aim of this study was to analyze the gender effect of the affected parent on age at onset and clinical presentation of offspring with juvenile HD. We also analyzed molecular features of the disease, including CAG mutation length and GluR6 gene polymorphism, according to the affected parent's gender. The mutation length was longer in paternally than in maternally transmitted HD juvenile patients (P = 0.025), nevertheless a similar mean early onset in the two groups (P&gt;0.05). This data was even enforced by that obtained from the whole cohort of patients included in the databank (n=600) where, in the presence of increased mean parent-child CAG repeat change in paternal vs. maternal meiotic transmissions (+7.3 vs. +0.7 CAG, P=0.0002), the mean parent-child year-of-onset change was similar in the two groups (-10.4 and -7.0 years, P&gt;0.05). A lower TAA-triplet in GluR6 was associated with an earlier age at onset in juvenile patients (P=0.031, R2=0.10). When we added the GluR6 effect on age at onset to the CAG expanded number effect (P=0.0001, R2= 0.68) by multiple regression approach, the coefficient of determination R2 increased to 0.81. This effect in addition to the expanded CAG repeat number, found in juvenile and not in adult patients, was slightly enforced by paternal compared to maternal transmissions (R2=0.82). Our findings suggest the occurrence of a weaker effect of the paternal mutation on juvenile age at onset in our population, possibly amplified by other genetic factors, such as the TAA-triplet length in the GluR6 gene. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","2-s2.0-0942290682","Italy"

However, the developmental course and underlying mechanism (bottom-up stimulus driven or top-down belief driven) associated with the angry-male bias remain unclear. Here we report that anger biases face gender categorization toward """"male"""" responding in children as young as 5-6 years. The bias is observed for both own- and other-race faces, and is remarkably unchanged across development (into adulthood) as revealed by signal detection analyses (Experiments 1-2). The developmental course of the angry-male bias, along with its extension to other-race faces, combine to suggest that it is not rooted in extensive experience, e.g., observing males engaging in aggressive acts during the school years. Based on several computational simulations of gender categorization (Experiment 3), we further conclude that (1) the angry-male bias results, at least partially, from a strategy of attending to facial features or their second-order relations when categorizing face gender, and (2) any single choice of computational representation (e.g., Principal Component Analysis) is insufficient to assess resemblances between face categories, as different representations of the very same faces suggest different bases for the angry-male bias. Our findings are thus consistent with stimulus-and stereotyped-belief driven accounts of the angry-male bias. Taken together, the evidence suggests considerable stability in the interaction between some facial dimensions in social categorization that is present prior to the onset of formal schooling. © 2015 Bayet, Pascalis, Quinn, Lee, Gentaz and Tanaka.""","2-s2.0-84926629147","Canada"

Participants from the US and Korea differed on all three subscales of materialism with US participants scoring higher on centrality but lower on success and happiness than Korean participants. The findings of this study provide valuable implications for fashion marketers and retailers in Korea and US.

"405",2015,"Social Politics","Toward a Political Sociology of Conjugal-Recognition Regimes: Gendered Multiculturalism in South African Marriage Law","""While conjugal-recognition policies are often a subject of political debate, scholars rarely attempt to explain the causal roots of such policies. When they do, their methods typically focus on discrete policies in isolation-same-sex marriage, no-fault divorce, etc.-with comparatively little investigation of potential connections among policies. This article begins to develop a more holistic approach focused on identifying and explaining what I call conjugal-recognition regimes. Adapting the concept from the existing literature on welfare regimes, I argue that conjugal-recognition regimes exist when an identifiable pattern or principle organizes an institution's conjugal-recognition policies. Such regimes shape social relations at multiple levels, both between the individuals in conjugal relationships and among the multiple institutions (state, religious, and so on) that confer official conjugal recognition. I argue that these organizing patterns or principles emerge out of historically specific, institutionally situated, and discursively constructed political debates on specific conjugal issues and, to the extent a regime in fact exists, go on to shape subsequent conjugal-policy controversies. I demonstrate these ideas through an extended analysis of post-apartheid South African marriage law, which has recently incorporated numerous previously excluded conjugal formations but has also assigned each new form to its own statutory and administrative structure or, as I call it, """"silo."""" I argue that these silos entrench a principle of """"gendered multiculturalism"""" that officially defines cultures in terms of their supposedly characteristic gender relations. This principle increasingly tends to embed religious and cultural elites' understandings of their respective traditions into the state's marriage laws. © 2015 The Author.""","2-s2.0-84942428261","South Africa"

"407",2015,"Journal of Product and Brand Management","Gender differences in information processing and transparency: Cases of apparel brands’ social responsibility claims","Purpose – The purpose of this study was to understand how male and female consumers differently evaluate sustainability claims from brands and how brands’ sustainability efforts and the presence/absence of information transparency in the claims affect their brand schemas differently. Design/methodology/approach – Five hundred participants were recruited for an online experiment implementing both treatment and message variance. PROCESS, a recently developed regression-based bootstrapping technique was used to test the hypotheses. Findings – Males were more likely than females to rely on their existing schemas for judgment in case of Made in USA but not Fair Labor claims. The presence of information transparency in claims reduced participants’ reliance on their schemas. Practical implications – The findings might be helpful for brands to design marketing claims with specific customer segments to stand out amidst advertisement clutter. Especially, brands targeting male consumers might try to build strong brand schemas starting the early stages of brand image building as males tend to consistently rely on their schemas for judgment. On the other hand, brands might benefit from providing transparent information about their sustainability efforts in their claims (especially those related to Made in USA) while targeting female consumers. However, irrespective of gender, brands might benefit from making claims with information transparency. Originality/value – This study investigated the influence of gender in evaluation of brands’ sustainability claims and the role of information transparency in the process, thereby filling a gap in literature. It is one of the very few studies to empirically investigate not only whether males and females are different in their information processing styles but also how such differences arise. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-84938570202","United States"
"408",2019,"Gender, Place and Culture","Studying marriage migration to Europe from below: informal practices of government, border struggles and multiple entanglements","The growing importance of marriage as a migration strategy has been accompanied by a problematisation and securitization of marriages between binational couples in media and policy discourse. Moreover, marriage migration has received increased scholarly attention. In this article, we propose an analytical framework for the study of marriage migration and its government that permits to transcend three biases and related blind spots that we identify in the existing literature. While this literature offers rich insights into marriage migration and states’ ever more laboured attempts to control and regulate it, this literature is, nevertheless, characterised by an implementation gap bias, a control bias and, finally, a destination country bias. To address these biases, we propose an analytical framework that is inspired by the autonomy of migration approach. We propose to ethnographically study binational couples’ encounters with marriage migration related authorities in countries of destination and citizenship with a particular focus on binational couples’ struggles for visas, resident permits and a right to family life. Illustrated through ethnographic research, we show that this methodology permits to highlight three aspects of marriage migration that have not been sufficiently considered so far. These include the securitization of marriage migration ‘from below’ through informal practices of government on the ‘street-level’, binational couples’ inherently political border struggles and their capacity to negotiate restrictive legislations and bureaucratic hurdles and, finally, what we call the multiple entanglements of binational couples in the border and citizenship regimes of two or more nation-state orders. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85060647892","Germany"

The data for the study emanate from the household roster component of the most recent nationally representative sample survey, the 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. The focus is on socio-economic and demographic characteristics, as well as coresidential patterns, of the elderly persons. Additionally, use is made of the 1960-2000 census results of Ghana in order to through light on the emerging phenomenon of population ageing in the country. The results show that the proportion of persons aged 60 years or older in Ghana has consistently risen from 5.2 percent in 1960 to 7.2 percent in 2000, representing 38 percent increase, while the number rose from 457,067 in 1960 to 1,367,343 in 2000, representing about 200 percent increase over the period. Differences by sex are marginal. Also, older adults in Ghana live in a variety of household arrangements. The elderly men are more likely to be living in nuclear households, while older women are more likely to be living in extended family households. Logistic regression analyses indicate that determinants of living with adult children and grandchildren differ by sex. A combination of fertility decline, migration, and urbanization puts the older women in a disadvantaged position since there are fewer adult children available to provide support and care, and there is no universal non-familial social security system. It can be argued that knowledge about the types of households in which older women live is a first step to understanding their needs in a part of the world with limited resources such as Ghana.","2-s2.0-37649020445","Ghana"

The authors developed a mediational model to examine the degree to which gender differences in anxiety are explained by instrumentality and mastery while controlling for the influence of environmental stress and social desirability. Undergraduates (159 men and 239 women) completed an online questionnaire including measures of mastery, instrumentality, daily hassles, social desirability, and anxiety. Women reported significantly lower levels of instrumentality and mastery and higher levels of anxiety than men. Path analyses indicated that instrumentality and mastery were both significant mediators of the relationship between gender and anxiety after controlling for social desirability and hassles. The addition of a direct path from gender to anxiety was not significant and did not improve the fit of the model. These findings suggest that differences in gender socialization and mastery learning experiences for men and women help account for the female preponderance of anxiety. Interventions aimed at building instrumentality and mastery, particularly among girls, may help buffer against anxiety. © The Author(s) 2012.","2-s2.0-84870152009","United States"

"413",2011,"Feminist Review","Communicative spaces of their own: Migrant girls performing selves using instant messaging software","In this article, we argue how instant messaging (IM) is actively made into a communicative space of their own among migrant girls. Triangulating data gathered through large-scale surveys, interviews and textual analysis of IM transcripts, we focus on Moroccan-Dutch girls who use instant messaging as a space where they can negotiate several issues at the crossroads of national, ethnic, racial, age and linguistic specificities. We take an intersectional perspective to disentangle how they perform differential selves using IM both as an onstage activity through which they express their communal, public and global youth cultural belongings and as a backstage activity through which they articulate their individual, private and intimate identity expression. Instant messaging appears to be a space where they can strategically (re-)position themselves. The relationship between the online world of IM and the off-line world is shown to be intricate and complex; at certain points, both worlds overlap and at others they diverge. Despite all existing constraints that are both related to gender restrictions, often disenfranchised family backgrounds, religious dictums, and surveillance by parents, siblings and peers, which affect Moroccan-Dutch girls in specific ways, IM is also understood as a unique space for exerting their agency in autonomous, playful and intimate ways. © 2011 Feminist Review.","2-s2.0-80755163095","Netherlands"

Case studies were conducted within two schools in socially deprived areas of Scotland. They included classroom observation, digital video and audio data collection, and a series of interviews with pupils and teachers. The task design created opportunities for interdisciplinary, collaborative learning and generated strong pupil engagement.

"415",2013,"Sexualities","National virtue and the 'media sexualisation of children' discourse in Australia","Most studies of the media sexualisation of children debate focus on its significance in terms of discourses of sexuality and gender. This article makes observations about public meetings called to express concern about media sexualisation held in several Australian capital cities 2009-2010 to argue that media sexualisation is also meaningful in relation to discourses of nation. Drawing on the claim made by Valerie Walkerdine that concern with the eroticisation of girls is a defence against acknowledgement of difficult sexual desires and Gayle Rubin's observation that concerns with children's sexuality often carry other political agendas, this article argues that the concern with media sexualisation of children in the Australian context carries meaning about national identity and national virtue. It places the emergence of the discourse in the recent history of revelations about the systemic abuse of children by the state and the Christian churches throughout the 20th century and into this century, and argues that the media sexualisation discourse constitutes subjects who, via their investment in innocence, are exonerated from any culpability in this compromising national history. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","2-s2.0-84883331040","Australia"

Only in the condition without any threat to the participant's anonymity was there no difference between men and women's reports of their sexual behavior. However, in every condition men reported having a significantly higher sociosexuality than women.

The autoethnographic approach used includes both written stories and photographic narrative. There have been times when my fat body has been seen by the medical profession as barren, incapable, and excessive and also times when I didn’t know whether I could trust a medical opinion to be objective, because I inhabit a fat body. I discuss medical and cultural assumptions about a fat woman’s ability to conceive, oppressive medical policies, such as how much weight a fat woman “should” gain in pregnancy and what she “should” eat according to medical guidelines. In addition, I document the complicating factor of having diabetes and the hypermonitoring of blood sugar and “dieting” to keep a baby safe, and the return of guilt about eating “the wrong things.” I tell these stories to illuminate what the medicalization of fatness, pregnancy, and early motherhood have been like, including the effect it had on my ability to practice fat acceptance. The article is framed by both scholarly and fat activist approaches to the discussion of fat embodiment, pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, in an attempt to expose discrimination and oppression of fat women’s bodies within the medical field.

Although many studies have highlighted a difference between males and females with regard to the expression of fear, gendered differences and similarities in the perception and expression of fear have remained largely unexplored within the context of tourism. The results show that gender, despite having been traditionally constructed as a binary concept, did not play a major role in influencing tourists' perceptions of fear on holiday. Interestingly however, the findings reveal that although men and women differ in their perception and expression of fear, a more marked distinction exists among the various masculinities and femininities within the men-women dichotomy. This implies that the investigation of gendered perceptions of fear needs to take into account the non-homogeneous nature of the two groups.

"420",2017,"Feminist Review","Slovenia's socialist superwoman: Feeding the family, nourishing the nation","This article explores how the Slovenian women's lifestyle magazine Naša žena (Our Woman) helped the Yugoslavian socialist project construct and shape the ideal socialist woman, and argues that she became the crucial ally in implementing socialist ideas in the everyday lives of Slovenians. The article shows how texts on food preparation and consumption, as well as those touching on household management and family care, published in Naša žena from 1960 to 1991 played an important part in the 'civilising' process that shaped behaviour, directed cultural and social practices, influenced social relations and constructed women's identities during socialism. We show how food-related texts (articles, recipes, columns, advertisements and advertorials) were never far removed from the larger political and economic socialist realities. In fact, they bore witness to changes in living standards and told stories about gender regimes, socialist ideologies and fantasies. These texts belong to a corpus of social transcripts that guide collective understandings of what it means to select, prepare, cook and eat food; what constitutes good cooking and eating; and who is responsible for preparing meals. Despite official socialist feminist rhetoric about freeing women from backward patriarchal arrangements, this article shows that texts offering food-related advice in socialist Yugoslavia contained explicit instructions for the 'correct' performance of the social roles of women, legitimising women's roles as worker, mother, wife and housekeeper. Above all, a woman was to be an 'engineer' of the private domain whose goals were to feed her family and keep the nation healthy and hence productive, and to modernise her kitchen in support of the technological and economic development of Yugoslavia. © 2017 The Feminist Review Collective.","2-s2.0-85044219867","Slovenia"

Accurately measuring the gender pay gap is an important exercise in order to assess how far we are from the ideal of equal pay for work of equal value. Determining the different sources of the gender pay gap is also very important in order to design appropriate policies for eliminating this gap. We develop an enhanced method to measure and decompose the gender pay gap. This method is based on the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique and on the Malmquist Index (MI). We use DEA and the MI to construct an index reflecting an adjusted measure of the gender pay gap, taking into account multiple productive characteristics and multiple types of pay. Furthermore, we propose a decomposition of the gender pay gap into four components: same-gender pay gap; cross-gender frontier gap magnitude; productive characteristics bias; and pay package bias. The method is applied to data relative to 15,712 men and 17,175 women working as business and administration associate professionals in the finance and insurance industry in 20 countries.

It is assumed, that people identify themselves with the people in the images and project their unconscious motives (e.g., achievement motive) onto them. As the TAT shows only men in the pictures, critics claimed the test is gender-biased; assuming women cannot identify with men in pictures. However, it was not assessed, whether female protagonists of the picture really trigger the same achievement motive as men. Therefore, two studies were conducted to address the gender difference and validity of the TAT using a version with only men in the pictures (study 1) or only women in the pictures (study 2).

Given the weight of work and family obligations, migrant women workers often turn to community-based organizations for assistance with securing work, negotiating an abusive workplace situation, and making ends meet on low wages. Increasingly, organizations are recognizing the social reproduction concerns of migrant women. In crafting responses to this reality, much work is undertaken by staff members, clients, and volunteers that is hidden from the organizations' funders, from the clients' employers, and from official statistics. The objective of this article is to reveal how and why nonprofit organizations can act as a space for the hidden labor of social reproduction, as well as for economic development experiments that account for the needs of social reproduction. Hidden labor is conceptualized as filling gaps in the social safety net created by a neoliberalizing society. In addition, it is the argument of this article that social reproduction is being reframed as a collective endeavor within organizations, where the ethic of care is potentially transforming an insidious political-economic context into a source of strength and resiliency for migrant women. Based on semi-structured interviews and participant observation in an organization in Chicago, this article provides a review of hidden labor within the space of nonprofit organizations. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84940305285","United States"

First, do young children with GNN peer preferences differ from childrenwith gender normative (GN) peer preferences in problem behaviors? Second, doGNNandGNchildren differ in sociability and isolation and do they have differential socialization opportunities with externalizing, internalizing, and socially competent peers?We employed a Bayesian approach for classifying children asGNNbased on their peer preferences as compared to their peers using a sample of Head Start preschool children from a large Southwestern city (N=257; 53% boys; M age=51 months; 66% Mexican American). To calculatesocializationopportunities, weassessedaffiliationtoeach child in theclassandweighted thatbyeachpeer'scharacteristics todeterminetheexposurethateachchildhadtodifferentkindsof peers.GNchildren of both sexes interacted more with same-sex peers,whichmay limit learning ofdifferent stylesof interaction. As compared to GN children, GNN children exhibited more engagement in other-sex activities and with other-sex play partners and GNN children experienced somewhat fewer peer interactions, but did not differ on problem behaviors or social competence. Boys with GNN peer preferences had increased exposure to peers with problem behaviors. GNN girls experienced little exposure to peers with problem behaviors, but they also had little exposure to socially competent peers,which may reduce learning social skills from peers. Implications of these findings for future socialization and development will be discussed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","2-s2.0-84864090667","United States"

"431",2018,"Biology of Sex Differences","Sex-specific differences in hepatic steatosis in obese spontaneously hypertensive (SHROB) rats","Background: Patients with metabolic syndrome, who are characterized by co-existence of insulin resistance, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, are also prone to develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Although the prevalence and severity of NAFLD is significantly greater in men than women, the mechanisms by which gender modulates the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis are poorly defined. The obese spontaneously hypertensive (SHROB) rats represent an attractive model of metabolic syndrome without overt type 2 diabetes. Although pathological manifestation caused by the absence of a functional leptin receptor has been extensively studied in SHROB rats, it is unknown whether these animals elicited sex-specific differences in the development of hepatic steatosis. Methods: We compared hepatic pathology in male and female SHROB rats. Additionally, we examined key biochemical and molecular parameters of signaling pathways linked with hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. Finally, using methods of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis, we quantified expression of 45 genes related to lipid biosynthesis and metabolism in the livers of male and female SHROB rats. Results: We show that all SHROB rats developed hepatic steatosis that was accompanied by enhanced expression of SREBP1, SREBP2, ACC1, and FASN proteins. The livers of male rats also elicited higher induction of Pparg, Ppara, Slc2a4, Atox1, Skp1, Angptl3, and Pnpla3 mRNAs. In contrast, the livers of female SHROB rats elicited constitutively higher levels of phosphorylated JNK and AMPK and enhanced expression of Cd36. Conclusion: Based on these data, we conclude that the severity of hepatic steatosis in male and female SHROB rats was mainly driven by increased de novo lipogenesis. Moreover, male and female SHROB rats also elicited differential severity of hepatic steatosis that was coupled with sex-specific differences in fatty acid transport and esterification. © 2018 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85053144830","United States"

Quantitative studies suggest that Albanian internal migration is pioneered by men, with women merely acceding to their wishes. This article addresses the undervalued role of women in the academic discourse concerning migration in Albania. Utilizing ethnographic research techniques, it explores the role of women migrating from rural to urban areas as part of a larger household and examines the coping and negotiating strategies used for survival in the city. Our findings reveal that women actively participate in the rural-to-urban migration process, including the initial decision to migrate and the choice of destination. Women's narratives provide evidence of specific emancipation strategies through which they express themselves and their new ways of living. Women adjust to and challenge their new urban environment through gaining paid employment and expanding their social networks, as well as experience emancipation through daughters and by changing their appearance, achieving varying degrees of personal and social prosperity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84922685564","Netherlands"
"433",2011,"NAN NU","Male honor and female chastity in early China","In many respects, masculinity in early China resembled practices which have been described by anthropologists researching the Mediterranean region. Maintaining a reputation for honor was particularly important to Chinese manhood. As the individual was tightly integrated into a social group, men had to control the behavior of those around them to defend themselves against possible shame. For this reason, men found it useful to regulate the sexual practices of female kin to defend their own honor. The emergence of female chastity was thus closely tied to the honor culture of early Chinese masculinity. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","2-s2.0-84855210066","Taiwan"
"434",2013,"Sexualities","'Erotic capital' and the power of desirability: Why 'honey money' is a bad collective strategy for remedying gender inequality","In this article I conduct a close reading of Catherine Hakim's theory concerning the relationship of sexual desirability to power and gender inequality. I suggest that Hakim's thesis requires renewed attention not only because of the international reach of her work, but because it reflects a general cultural sentiment concerning women's sexuality and power. I argue that her primary concept-erotic capital-is overstretched, internally inconsistent, and asociological, glossing over the structures of race, class and age that mediate women's access to the resource. Moreover, I show the two ways that Hakim might remedy her theory, but conclude that both are indefensible. In turn, the policy implications Hakim derives from her theory of erotic capital, along with the more general cultural notion that equates sexual desirability with power, are put in high relief. I conclude by noting the existence of a productive stream of sociological theory-the sexual fields framework (Green, 2008)-that develops a concept of erotic/sexual capital which predates Hakim's work and offers a more sociologically grounded analysis of power and desirability. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","2-s2.0-84875078597","Canada"

"436",2018,"Social Problems","Who gets ahead and who falls behind during the transition to high school? Academic performance at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender","Academic stratification during educational transitions may be maintained, disrupted, or exacerbated. This study marks the first to use national data to investigate how the transition to high school (re)shapes academic status at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender. We seek to identify the role of the high school transition in shaping racial/ethnic and gender stratification by contextualizing students’ academic declines during the high school transition within the longer window of their educational careers. Using Add Health, we find that white and black boys experience the greatest drops in their grade point averages (GPAs). We also find that the maintenance of high academic grades between the eighth and ninth grades varies across racial/ethnic and gender subgroups; higher-achieving middle school black boys experience the greatest academic declines. Importantly, we find that white and black boys also faced academic declines before the high school transition, whereas their female student peers experienced academic declines only during the transition to high school. We advance current knowledge on educational stratification by identifying the transition to high school as a juncture in which boys’ academic disadvantage widens and high-achieving black boys lose their academic status at the high school starting gate. Our study also underscores the importance of adopting an intersectional framework that considers both race/ethnicity and gender. Given the salience of high school grades for students’ long-term success, we discuss the implications of this study for racial/ethnic and gender stratification during and beyond high school. © The Author(s) 2018.

The results showed that paternal harsh parenting was only associated with boys’ aggressive behaviors and maternal harsh parenting was only associated with boys’ and girls’ verbal aggression. Adolescents’ verbal and relational aggressions were negatively associated with their peer acceptance. Verbal aggression was more strongly and negatively associated with girls’ peer acceptance. The results imply that in the Chinese cultural context, paternal harsh parenting may compromise boys’ peer acceptance through boys’ verbal and relational aggression as mediators, whereas maternal harsh parenting may impair children's peer acceptance through children's verbal aggression as a mediator, especially for girls. These results provide a theoretical basis for ameliorating the negative effect of harsh parenting on early adolescents’ peer acceptance by reducing their aggressive behaviors, with different strategies between boys and girls. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85005939729","China"

Critical theory and critical discourse analysis, supported by narrative analysis and visual analysis, offer a robust methodology to problematize the manner in which textually mediated discourses impact social policy reform for recruiting, retraining and retaining older workers. The results show that still in such an “age positive” social policy environment, negative stereotypes about older workers persist, threatening to constrain social change. An exemplary analysis of two texts, representative of those related to Australian government initiatives to reform access to work for older citizens, provides an accessible means of (re)evaluating if and how such policies are more inclusive of older workers.

De Lange and Mügge therefore ask how differences in ideology shape right-wing populist parties’ ideas on gender. Drawing on the qualitative content analysis of party manifestos, they compare the gender ideologies and concrete policy proposals of national and neoliberal populist parties in the Netherlands and Flanders from the 1980s to the present. They find that some parties adhere to a modern or modern-traditional view, while others espouse neo-traditional views. Moreover, some right-wing populist parties have adopted gendered readings of issues surrounding immigration and ‘Islam’, while others have not. The variation in stances on ‘classical’ gender issues can be explained by the genealogy and ideological orientation of the parties, whereas gendered views on immigration and Islam are influenced by contextual factors, such as 9/11. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84928754534","Netherlands"
"440",2016,"International Journal of Transgenderism","The lived experience of transgender people of talking therapies","New ways of thinking about gender identity have led to a transformation in transgender care from the psychological professions. Historically, the change can be seen as a move from treating transgender people as insane, to having a medical condition, and finally as individuals with a legitimate and acceptable gender identity. The psychological therapy professions have responded with guidelines and standards of care urging therapists to adopt an affirmative approach to the individual's unique experience of gender. Despite this, few studies have looked at the subjective experience transgender people have of psychotherapy. In response to this a qualitative research project was undertaken to explore the lived experience that six transgender people had of talking therapies. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis four master themes emerged from the interview data. These are “a fearful time,” “becoming comfortable with their personal gender,” “the importance of the relationship with the practitioner,” and a sense of “moving beyond therapy.” This article gives some background to the project, its execution, and its findings. The research highlights that for transgender people psychotherapy remains a fearful encounter, often associated with medical intervention. However, the quality of the therapeutic relationship can bring acceptance of self and hope for a future beyond therapy. The research brings valuable insight for therapists working with transgender clients and adds to the theory and practice of psychotherapy with signposts for training and future research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84977138005","United Kingdom"

Improving this competence involves developing self-assessment skills that help students to analyze their own performance. However, more research is needed on the factors affecting self-assessment of the oral presentation competence, such as the speaker's confidence and the summative use of self-assessment that can act as a sort of incentive for students. A study with 201 students was carried out, focusing on a segmentation analysis and differentiating by gender and level of performance on the assessed competence. Results show that: (1) the existence of incentives is the only variable that significantly influences men's self-assessment, whereas women's self-assessment is basically conditioned by their confidence as speakers; and (2) the self-assessment of the worst speakers, rated by teachers, is influenced only by the existence of incentives, whereas the best speakers give themselves higher scores when they feel confident about speaking in public. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85046020381","Spain"

The data, collected through individual interviews, illustrate how these three men interpreted SEL, and their role in the development of children’s social, emotional and behavioural (SEB) skills, in response to their perceptions of pupils’ home-life. In particular, the sample identified the children’s fathers’ perceived ability/inability as a main cause of pupils’ SEB deficiencies. Consequently, the three male staff members maintained that in order to advocate and encourage alternative, appropriate behaviours, they should act as ‘replacement fathers’ and become ‘role models’. The findings contribute to existing debates relating to the notion of ‘positive male role models’ in primary schools and the propensity for staff to engage in parental blame. The implications of these findings are discussed, and suggestions that call for a more democratic and cooperative exchange of knowledge between parents and teachers are made. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-84971435028","United Kingdom"

With a sample of 194 undergraduate college students, the present study examined whether accuracy of self-reported GPA differed based on level of academic performance or level of academic self-efficacy and whether those differences were moderated by gender and year in college. Significant gender differences were found only within the lower academic performance group and the lower academic self-efficacy group, with females on average overreporting their actual college GPA and males on average underreporting their actual college GPA. Thus, research on college achievement that is conducted with students in lower achieving groups or with lower academic self-efficacy may benefit from the use of university-record GPA data as opposed to self-report data and may need to consider gender differences carefully to guard against potential bias in self-reported values for these groups.","2-s2.0-84903511653","United States"
"444",2014,"Group Processes and Intergroup Relations","The risk of male success and failure: How performance outcomes along with a high-status identity affect gender identification, risk behavior, and self-esteem","Previous research has demonstrated that failure on a task may at times increase self-esteem, known as the failure-as-an-asset effect. This effect is observed when high-status group members (e.g., referring to management positions: men) show poor performance in a domain that is seen as a low-status domain-one in which the low-status group (e.g., referring to management positions: women) typically outperforms the high-status group. In line with social identity theory, in this case the poor performance leads high-status group members to a strong identification with the high-status ingroup, resulting in higher state self-esteem. However, social identity theory originally refers not only to self-evaluation, but also to the influence on individual behavior. Building on that, we predicted that if high-status group members show higher ingroup identification after negative individual feedback in a low-status domain, they should also show stronger ingroup prototypical behavior. A great deal of research has indicated that women's behavior is more risk-averse than is men's behavior. Thus, men should show riskier behavior after a poor performance on a test in which women outperform men. Two studies support our hypothesis. Men with an alleged individual low performance on a fictitious test reported riskier behavioral intentions (Experiment 1), and actually showed riskier behavior in an investment game (Experiment 2), when men were outperformed by women rather than when women were outperformed by men. The opposite pattern was found for men with an individual positive performance. As predicted, these effects were mediated by men's gender identification. Practical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2013.","2-s2.0-84894226243","Germany"

A total of 632 respondents completed the survey of which 41% were gay men and 29% were lesbian. The majority of participants were White, non-Hispanic (93%), married/partnered (78%), and had health insurance (88%). The majority (67%) reported they always or often disclosed their sexual orientation/identity to an HCP and few had negative reactions in the health care setting (<10%). Health care settings with equality signs and gender-neutral language were perceived as safer. Participants' responses suggested need for policy changes and improved cultural competence among HCPs.

The contextualist approach underlines how the dynamics of interaction between the individual and micro-sociocultural contexts play a mediating role on developmental processes. Studies by Pianta, in particular, ascribed to the teacher-pupil interaction a crucial developmental function in the adaptation of the child, both in preschool age children and in the subsequent years of primary school. The purpose of this study is to examine the characteristics of the teacher-pupil relationship when the teacher is male in the primary school setting. There were 310 children involved, equally distributed by gender, with their 52 teachers, of whom 42 were female and 10 were male. The analyses carried out reveal statistically relevant differences between the two groups of teachers on the issue of the way male teachers assess their relationship with female pupils. More than their male colleagues, female teachers tend to evaluate girls in a significantly different way as far as closeness and dependency are concerned. The data that emerges calls for careful consideration of the effect that the gender imbalance marking the teaching population in the early stages of schooling can have on aspects of child development. © Quaglia et al.","2-s2.0-84886561009","Italy"

The variables were measured using the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), and the Attitudes toward Gender Stereotypes in Romantic Relationships Scale (AGSRRS). These inventories were administered to 250 undergraduate students at Istanbul University in Istanbul and Suleyman Demirel University in Isparta, Turkey. Results indicate that benevolent sexism mediates the relationship between hostile sexism and male dominance. Benevolent sexism also mediates femininity and male dominance, as well as femininity and male assertiveness. Hostile sexism was mediated only between the masculine personality trait and benevolent sexism. The present findings expand the literature on sex role orientation by revealing evidence that masculine and feminine individuals experience ambivalent sexism distinctively. The results are discussed in terms of the assumptions of sex role orientation, ambivalent sexism, and gender stereotypes. © 2017, PsychOpen. All Rights reserved.","2-s2.0-85032656185","Turkey"

We use these two regional datasets to examine the changing travel behavior among Millennials and to put these changes in context by comparing them with changes among other social groups of interest: women and minorities. We find that the travel behavior of young people did not change substantially between 2000 and 2012. Where there are changes, these pale in comparison to the changes among women and black residents. And finally, we find that the built environment factors appear to influence travel more in 2012 than in 2000.

However, there was basically no effect for a task that was only very loosely connected to grammatical gender (similarity rating of word pairs). In contrast to previous studies that found effects of the German and Spanish grammatical gender in English (a nongendered language), our study did not produce such effects for Tamil, again after controlling for alternative explanations, which can be taken as additional evidence for the existence of a purely linguistic grammatical gender effect.

Situated beyond Bedouin women's permitted space and embedded in Israeli-Jewish space, institutions of higher education are sites of displacement that present Bedouin women students with new normative structures, social interactions and opportunities for academic learning. As such, they become a discursive arena for the articulation and reconstruction of their previously held conceptions and identities. Often the journey to institutions of higher education signifies for Bedouin women the first opportunity to venture out of their community. Traveling to the university as students, returning home as educated women and embarking on professional careers outside tribal neighborhoods and villages involves moving across and beyond different locales. Such translocal mobility necessitates constant negotiation between seemingly contradictory cultural constructs and the development of varied spatial bridging strategies. The article seeks to contribute to Bedouin gender studies by going beyond the functional role of higher education institutions as well as the gendered hierarchies of women's mobility, placing emphasis, instead, on the effects of socio-spatial contextuality that shapes Bedouin women's experiences. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84880268817","Israel"
"455",2013,"Sex Roles","Being a Body: Women's Appearance Related Self-Views and their Dehumanization of Sexually Objectified Female Targets","When sexually objectified, women are reduced to their bodies or sexual body parts and become likely targets of dehumanization. Not only men, but also women engage in this process. In the present research, we tested the link between women's appearance related self-views and their tendency to dehumanize sexually objectified female targets. Specifically, we test two mediational models and predict that (1) women's motivation to look attractive to men and (2) their tendency to internalize the sociocultural beauty standards are linked with the dehumanization of sexually objectified female targets, and their level of self-objectification mediates both relations. To test these hypotheses, a sample of 55 heterosexual undergraduate female students from Northern Italy volunteered. Participants' motivation to look attractive to men, their level of internalization of the sociocultural beauty standards, and their tendency to self-objectify was measured. Results confirmed that only sexually objectified female targets were significantly dehumanized, while their non-objectified counterparts were not. Moreover, both participants' motivation to look attractive to men and their tendency to internalize the sociocultural beauty standards were positively linked with the dehumanization of sexually objectified female targets. As expected, these relations were mediated by participants' level of self-objectification. These results show that higher levels of self-objectification among those women who are motivated either to look attractive to men or to internalize the sociocultural beauty standards are linked with their tendency to dehumanize sexually objectified female targets. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84874945849","Italy"
"456",2012,"Columbia Law Review","Gender discrimination and the Thirteenth Amendment","Although the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified more than a century and a half ago, courts have yet to delve into its relevance to gender discrimination. This oversight is unfortunate given the extent to which jurisprudence about another Reconstruction Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, has evolved beyond its original racial confines to include gender, disability, sexual orientation, and other forms of group-specific inequalities. A progressive interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment should likewise expand congressional enforcement authority beyond race. As was the case with its Fourteenth Amendment counterpart, the Thirteenth Amendment was initially ratified to prevent racial discrimination, but its antisubordination principles are also relevant to policies for abolishing gender discrimination. This underexplored area of law offers tremendous potential for providing redress against a variety of private, state, and institutional forms of gender discrimination that are not actionable under current civil rights statutes. This Essay demonstrates how broad concepts of liberty, which abolitionists, feminists, and Congress developed before and after the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, seamlessly lend themselves to the enforcement of gender equality norms. Over the last forty years, the Supreme Court has recognized the existence of federal authority to prevent state gender discrimination. The Thirteenth Amendment is a source of legislative authority that can be used to address private acts of discrimination.","2-s2.0-84878199352","United States"

While few quantitative studies on the effectiveness of clickers have been published, it is generally reported that clickers have been well-received by the students who use them. Two separate populations (Winter 2006 and Spring 2006) of engineering students were given clickers to use during a general chemistry class. Clicker use was compared to student grades for each course. During both terms, a higher percentage of female students than male students """"actively participated"""" in the lectures, where active participation was defined as answering more than 75% of the clicker questions over the course of the term. Active male students earned final grades about 10 points higher than non-active male students. Active female students, however, scored only about 5 points higher than non-active female students. Student learning was assessed by comparing performance on exam questions and clicker questions with similar content. Students who answered clicker questions correctly were 11-13% more likely to answer the corresponding exam questions correctly than were students who did not answer the clicker question.

We examined how factors associated with HIV-related stigma differed by gender, using data from the 2008-2009 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS). Descriptive, bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted on selected HIV-related stigma indicators for men and women. Bivariate analyses showed significant gender differences in the overall HIV Stigma index with a higher proportion of women than men presented at the highest stigma level (4.9% vs 2.7%, p < 0.01). Women were more likely to express higher stigmatic attitudes for all components of stigma measured than men. Multivariate analyses showed that HIV-related knowledge had significant inverse dose-response for both men and women. For instance, compared to women in the first HIV-related knowledge quartile, a 1 unit increase in HIV-related knowledge among women at the third HIV-related knowledge quartile was expected to lead to a 63.8% decrease in HIV-related stigma (95% CI [0.21, 0.63]) for women with high stigma, 57.8% decrease for similar women with medium stigma (95% CI [0.33, 0.55]) and 28.4% decrease for those with low stigma (95% CI [0.57, 0.90]). Acceptance with the statement """"a husband is justified to hit or beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him"""" was a significant risk factor for expression of stigmatising attitudes at all levels for women (High: OR = 1.49, 95% CI [1.02, 2.17]), Medium: OR = 1.47, 95% CI [1.18, 1.82], Low: OR = 1.38, 95% CI [1.10, 1.73]) and men at medium stigma (OR = 2.02, 95% CI [1.38, 2.95]). Other notable gender differences were found in employment, marital status, ethnicity, region of residence, wealth and media exposure. Our results showed that women in the general Kenyan population had higher stigmatic attitudes than men.

Results from two laboratory experiments show how participants react to ambitious decision makers in simple bargaining scenarios. The results indicate that observers tend to equate ambition for decision-making authority with self-interested, unfair, male behavior. Moreover, observers tend to be less satisfied with a decision made by an ambitious decision maker compared to the same decision made by an unambitious decision maker. That is, people generally dislike ambitious decision makers independent of the actual decision that is made.

Unemployment differentials by nativity, race and gender from 2007 to 2013 in the U.S.","We use data from the Current Population Survey from 2007 and 2013 to investigate demographic differentials in unemployment during the Great Recession in the U.S. Although our analysis is primarily exploratory and descriptive, our major research objective is to illuminate the unemployment differential between the foreign born and the native born. The findings indicate that during the height of the Great Recession, the foreign born had higher unemployment rates than the native born. However, this differential is statistically explained by their observed characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, gender, age and education. With the net of those variables and a few other demographic covariates, foreign born workers as an overall group actually had somewhat lower chances of being unemployed than native born workers. This finding is discussed in terms of the selectivity of immigrant workers and the possibility that they are somewhat more immediately dependent on having a job. After breaking down the foreign born into major racial/ethnic groups, the results suggest that foreign-born blacks and foreign-born Hispanics are particularly selective with the net of their observed characteristics.

The author argues that such criticism neglects how talk of trauma and microaggressions attempts to affectively manage structural violence’s failure to manifest in the form of discrete, identifiable, and extraordinary events. To illustrate this, she turns to the poetry of Claudia Rankine and the performance art of Emma Sulkowicz as aesthetic treatments of racial microaggression and sexual trauma, respectively. Rankine’s and Sulkowicz’s works belong to an emergent genre the author calls the coincidence report, in which subjects with no proof of structural violence except for their own feelings must cope with what happens when an event doesn’t. Ultimately, both artists sideline attempts to reconstruct the event in favor of redistributing specific affects throughout their respective publics. In both cases, these affects are blue–that is, depressive (Rankine) and obscene (Sulkowicz). Subjects in the blue find themselves ambivalently attached to living politically in the shadow of an event even as they detach from the fantasy that political life is less disappointing, depressing, or deflating than it actually is. © 2017 Women & Performance Project Inc.","2-s2.0-85030566645","United States"

In a study, we examined perceptions about men and women of the past, present, and future in Spain and focused on the influence of an important demographic variable on these perceptions: the population size of people's location of residence. Results showed that people perceived an increase in similarity of men and women from the past to the present and from the present to the future. In less-populated locations, however, men and women were more gender stereotyped and, consequently, still perceived to be further from equality than those in more populated areas. We concluded that the study of dynamic gender stereotypes benefits from extensive research in populations that vary in their demographic characteristics and shows the importance of recent movements in rural areas supporting women's participation in the modernization process.

While Samoa became the first Pacific independent state to implement a parliamentary gender quota in 2013, a campaign for 22 reserved seats in the Papua New Guinea Parliament before the 2012 general election was unsuccessful. Drawing on media analysis and interviews with key players in the gender quota debates in both countries, this article examines why the push for a quota succeeded in Samoa and not in Papua New Guinea. The local, external and structural factors commonly found in gender quota literature can help to explain the divergent outcomes of the gender quota campaigns in these two countries.

"473",2016,"Social Media and Society","Baking Gender Into Social Media Design: How Platforms Shape Categories for Users and Advertisers","In recent years, several popular social media platforms have launched freeform custom gender fields. This decision reconstitutes gender categories beyond an oppressive binary only permitting “males” and “females.” In this work, we uncover many different user-facing gender category design strategies within the social media ecosystem, ranging from custom gender options (on Facebook, Google+, and Pinterest) to the absence of gender fields entirely (on Twitter and LinkedIn). To explore how gender is baked into platform design, this article investigates the 10 most popular English-speaking social media platforms by performing recorded walkthroughs from two different subject positions: (1) a new user registering an account, and (2) a new advertiser creating an ad. We explore several different spaces in social media software where designers commonly program gender—sign-up pages, profile pages, and advertising portals—to consider (1) how gender is made durable through social media design, and (2) the shifting composition of the category of gender within the social media ecosystem more broadly. Through this investigation, we question how these categorizations attribute meaning to gender as they materialize in different software spaces, along with the recursive implications for society. Ultimately, our analysis reveals how social media platforms act as intermediaries within the larger ecosystem of advertising and web analytics companies. We argue that this intermediary role entrusts social media platforms with a considerable degree of control over the generation of broader categorization systems, which can be wielded to shape the perceived needs and desires of both users and advertising clients. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-85016049326","United States"

The aim of the current study was to investigate potential cross-gender identification in girls exposed prenatally to high concentrations of androgens due to classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Assessment included two standardized measures and a short parent interview assessing frequency of behavioral features of cross-gender identification as conceptualized in Part A of the diagnostic criteria for gender identity disorder (GID) in the DSM-IV-TR. Next, because existing measures may have conflated gender role behavior with gender identity and because the distinction is potentially informative, we factor analyzed items from the measures which included both gender identity and gender role items to establish the independence of the two constructs. Participants were 43 girls and 38 boys with CAH and 41 unaffected female and 31 unaffected male relatives, aged 4- to 11-years. Girls with CAH had more cross-gender responses than female controls on all three measures of cross-gender identification as well as on a composite measure of gender identity independent of gender role behavior. Furthermore, parent report indicated that 5/39 (12.8 %) of the girls with CAH exhibited cross-gender behavior in all five behavioral domains which comprise the cross-gender identification component of GID compared to 0/105 (0.0 %) of the children in the other three groups combined. These data suggest that girls exposed to high concentrations of androgens prenatally are more likely to show cross-gender identification than girls without CAH or boys with and without CAH. Our findings suggest that prenatal androgen exposure could play a role in gender identity development in healthy children, and may be relevant to gender assignment in cases of prenatal hormone disruption, including, in particular, cases of severely virilized 46, XX CAH. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84931009878","United Kingdom"

"482",2012,"Demographic Research","Grandparenting and mothers' labour force participation: A comparative analysis using the generations and gender survey","BACKGROUND: It is well known that the provision of public childcare plays an important role for women labour force participation and its availability varies tremendously across countries. In many countries, informal childcare is also important and typically provided by the grandparents, but its role on mothers' employment is not yet well understood. Understanding the relationship between labour supply decisions and grandparental childcare is complex. While the provision of grandparental childcare is clearly a function of the social and institutional context of a country, it also depends on family preferences, which are typically unobserved in surveys. OBJECTIVE: We analyze the role of informal childcare provided by grandparents on mothers' labour force participation keeping unobserved preferences into account. METHODS: Bivariate probit models with instrumental variables are estimated on data from seven countries (Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, Russia and The Netherlands) drawn from the Generations and Gender Survey. RESULTS: We find that only in some countries mothers' employment is positively and significantly associated with grandparents providing childcare. In other countries, once we control for unobserved preferences, we do not find this effect. CONCLUSIONS: The role of grandparents is an important element to reconcile work and family for women in some countries. Our results show the importance of considering family preferences and country differences when studying the relationship between grandparental childcare and mothers' labour supply. COMMENTS: Our results are consistent with previous research on this topic. However, differently from previous studies, we conduct separate analyses by country and show that the effect of grandparental childcare varies considerably. The fact that we also include in the analyses Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia and Georgia is an important novelty as there are no studies on this issue for these countries. © 2011 Arnstein Aassve, Bruno Arpino & Alice Goisis.","2-s2.0-84864373148","United Kingdom"
"483",2018,"American Review of Public Administration","Gender Representation and Student Performance: Representative Bureaucracy Goes to Korea","The literature on representative bureaucracy argues that bureaucrats who reflect the diversity of citizens are more likely to be responsive to the public. Although substantial research has supported the claim, most studies are conducted in Western countries such as the United States, and the evidence from other contexts is extremely limited. This raises two important questions: Does the relationship remain valid in a centralized Asian country? If so, under what conditions does representative bureaucracy matter more? This study investigates these questions by using a data set on secondary education in South Korea. Findings suggest that female students perform better when they are taught by female teachers, which strengthens the external validity of the theory. The positive link between female teachers and female student performance is greater when teachers have more discretion and interact more with each other. However, value consensus weakens the relationship between gender representation and student performance. Clientele diversity matters in gender representation at the managerial level, but sector differences are not statistically supported. These findings illustrate the need to take both national and organizational contexts seriously in representative bureaucracy theory. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-85045621123","United States"

Older adults seeking same-sex relationships emphasized romance more so than older adults seeking cross-sex relationships. Further, adults seeking same-sex relationships who lived in environments with low structural support for GLBT people were most likely to emphasize a desire for shared experiences. Findings suggest that despite the scripted nature of dating profiles and similarity in thematic content, older adults seeking same-sex relationships in different geographic areas may have distinct motivations when seeking a romantic partner. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85034017751","United States"

With almost no hierarchy, their action plans favor participation of female workers at the bottom of the social ladder, centering on forums where work in itself can be discussed.

"487",2015,"Language and Speech","Perceptions of Gender and Femininity Based on Language: Implications for Transgender Communication Therapy","Recent research presents a picture of diminishing gender differences in language. Two experiments examined whether language use can predict perceptions of gender and femininity; one included male and female speakers telling a personal narrative, the other also included male-to-female transgender speakers and analyzed an oral picture description. In each experiment, raters read transcribed samples before judging the gender and rating the femininity of the speaker. Only number of T-units, words per T-unit, dependent clauses per T-unit, and personal pronouns per T-unit emerged as different between gender groups. As none of the variables were strongly correlated with perceptual judgments, regression analysis was used to determine how combinations of linguistic variables predict female/feminine ratings. Results from these two studies demonstrate that gender-related differences in language use for these two contexts are limited, and that any relationship of language to perceptions of gender and femininity is complex and multivariate. This information calls into question the utility of training key language features in transgender communication therapy. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","2-s2.0-84940923250","United States"

"490",2013,"Language and Computers","Gender, culture and language: Evidence from language corpora about the development of cultural differences between Englishspeaking countries","This article takes as its starting point the impression reported by Leech and Fallon (1992) of a marked cultural difference between the US and Britain emerging from their examination of lexical frequencies in the Brown and LOB corpora from 1961. In what they term 'one wild generalization' they propose a picture of the US in 1961 as more masculine, militaristic and dynamic, set against a Britain more given to benefitting from wealth rather than creating it, and to family and emotional life. Here I investigate a number of the electronic corpora which are now available to see if this impression was still valid towards the end of the 20th century, in some cases even into the 21st. Some of these corpora also make it possible to bring authentic spoken language into the comparison, and to differentiate between male and female language. Besides Brown and LOB, the following corpora are examined: Frown, FLOB, BNC, COCA, TIME and the various ICE corpora, as well as the Australian Corpus of English and the Wellington Written Corpus of New Zealand English. The comparison comprises the following: (i) frequencies of HE and SHE (with inflections), (ii) proportions of HE and SHE made up of the respective subject forms, seen as a general involvement measure, (iii) the most frequent lexical verbs occurring after he and she, and (iv) frequencies of a set of general cultural terms found to be overrepresented in AmE vs. BrE in the material from 1961. Results show a clear tendency towards greater gender equality, both in overall frequencies and in the proportion of subject forms, although Britain is still ahead of the US, as are Australia and New Zealand. The lexical verbs reveal a greater proportion of cognitive verbs after she, and more verbs denoting motion and other activity after he. The general cultural terms from 1961 show that even here the gap has narrowed. The overall impression is one of a widespread cultural convergence.","2-s2.0-84902656271","Norway"

Drawing on negative reinforcement theory, the current study sought to examine the potential role of distress tolerance, defined as the ability to persist in goal-directed activity while experiencing emotional distress, as a potential mechanism that may underlie both internalizing and externalizing symptoms among 231 Caucasian and African American youth (M age = 10.9 years; 45.5% female; 54.5% Caucasian ethnicity). A series of regressions resulted in significant moderated relationships, such that low distress tolerance conferred increased risk for alcohol use among Caucasians, delinquent behavior among African Americans, and internalizing symptoms among females.

Employing a grounded theory approach to analyze the videos and building on sociological analyses of changing sexuality norms, the author develops the concept of “disregarding heteronormativity” to account for processes that draw attention away from the widespread privileging and normalizing of heterosexuality. Indeed, findings reveal that makers of the videos not only localized anti-LGBTQ violence and harassment to adolescent schools, emphasizing the decline or disappearance of discriminatory events into adulthood, but also emphasized happiness and positivity more than power relations and structural constraints. At times, this emphasis included suggestions that bullied LGBTQ youth could improve their lives by adopting a more positive outlook or ignoring the negative opinions of other people. Thus, makers of the videos generally positioned violence against queer youth as primarily solvable through emotional management, contributing to the individualizing and depoliticizing of this social problem. In contrast, the author argues for analyses that resist the disregarding of heteronormativity and instead position unequal power relations as enduring and widespread structural features of US society. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-85009186316","United States"

It focuses on the experiences of a group of female adolescents, categorised as ‘child marriage victims’, residing at the shelter. The analysis of in-depth life history interviews collected over a two-week period in October 2014 reveals that the adolescents contest the legislative victimhood imposed on them. For them, their marriages and pre-marital relationships are an expression of romantic and sexual agency, in contravention of familial norms. In this context, the adolescents perceive the shelter as a punitive space and interpret their enforced stay for ‘protection’ and ‘rehabilitation’ as an extension of familial control and regulation of their lives. The protectionism-as-safety discourse rewrites their agency as victimhood and transforms the shelter into a site where everyday forms of gendered power inequalities within social relations in the household are authorised and reproduced by the state and NGO. The adolescents perceive themselves as ‘bad girls’ and adopt various strategies to insist on their rehabilitation into ‘good girls’ to secure release from the shelter often by enacting the ‘victimhood’ expected of them. This allows for unique expressions of agency in an otherwise constrained context but hinders relationships of solidarity with other residents. Overall, the article highlights the need to challenge the ways in which patriarchal norms continue to spatially govern and discipline the expression of female sexuality and agency through 'safe spaces' in India. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85064611842","United Kingdom"

However, tools for measuring father involvement have not kept pace with the expanding understanding of the roles of fathers, and in the area of child health, are blunt. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a self-report measure of father involvement in preschooler's health, the Father Involvement in Health-Preschool (FIH-PS). In Phase 1 (item generation), 47 items were developed based on previous qualitative work and vetted through cognitive interviews with 21 fathers of children ages 3-5 years (preschool). In Phase 2 (psychometric validation), 560 fathers of 3- to 5-year-olds (n = 392 resident, n = 168 nonresident) completed the FIH-PS item bank. Participants were predominantly White (64%), had private health insurance (53%), had a mean age of 33 years, and half of them were married. Item response theory was used to determine measurement scoring. The FIH-PS Scale was reduced from a 47-item bank to a total of 20 items supporting a 4-factor scale made up of Acute Illness, General Well-Being, Emotional Health, and Role Modeling. Following exploratory (n = 280) and confirmatory factor (n = 280) analyses, the scale followed a bifactor structure, was internally consistent (Cronbach's a = .953), and discriminated among fathers with lower involvement.

The study highlighted gendered patterns of take-up of flexible working. Women who worked flexibly or part time typically did so to combine working with caring commitments, in ways that damaged their career prospects. In contrast men typically deferred working flexibly to a later stage when their career had progressed further. There was therefore a clear impact on current and future salary for women taking up flexible working arrangements, which was not equivalent for the men who did so.

Cross-gender behavior was assessed by two items from the CBCL: """"behaves like opposite sex"""" and """"wishes to be of opposite sex."""" As part of an ongoing longitudinal study of the Netherlands Twin Registry, mothers were asked to complete the CBCL for their twins when they were 7 (n~14,000 twins) and 10 years old (n~8,500 twins). The prevalence of cross-gender behavior (as measured by maternal report of behaving like or wishing to be the opposite sex) was 3.2% and 5.2% for 7-year-old boys and girls, respectively, and decreased to 2.4% and 3.3% for 10-year-old boys and girls.

"501",2016,"Perspectives on Politics","Fast-Tracked or Boxed In? Informal Politics, Gender, and Women's Representation in Putin's Russia","Why hasn't the marked increase in women in politics over the last half century led to the expected results of increased gender equality and more democracy? In order to propose a new answer to this question, which is central for both theoretical and empirical feminist political science, I look at the case of Putin's Russia as one of the authoritarian-leaning regimes that have promoted women into politics while simultaneously becoming more misogynist. Building on feminist institutionalism and the study of Russia's regime dynamics, both of which are extending the study of informal institutions, I claim that women are being fast-tracked into politics informally, not just formally such as by party or legislative quotas. Yet these women are then boxed in by informal rules and by parallel institutions and posts, with virtually no opportunities to advocate for women's interests. Putin's regime has promoted women to be stand ins during times of crisis or change, loyalists and showgirls when the regime needs to showcase elections and representation, and cleaners when the appearance of corruption threatens the regime. Even demonstrations of ultimate loyalty have not protected those women who once advocated for feminist policies. This exercise in concept building suggests a framework for thinking about the importance and operation of informal institutions, sustained by gendered and homophobic rules, as a bulwark of male dominance that undermines women's representation. There are also important policy implications, as advocates have been pushing for more women in politics to address a variety of ills that, my analysis suggests, will not be solved by numbers alone.

One reason for the inconsistent findings may be that most studies in this stream of research have neglected to examine individual differences. In the current study, we aimed to advance research on the pedagogical value of providing students with access to PPT slide handouts by examining whether self-efficacy and gender influence the effect of PPT slide provision on academic performance. We found no evidence to suggest that the provision of slide handouts has broad, unconditional pedagogical value. Instead, we found that both self-efficacy and gender moderated the extent to which the availability of the handouts enhanced or hindered students’ performance. As predicted, both students high on self-efficacy and males performed significantly better when they were provided with handouts. Conversely, students low on self-efficacy performed significantly worse when the handouts were provided. Female students also trended toward lower performance when the handouts were provided. Additionally, we found that students who were provided with PPT handouts perceived their instructor as more effective, and that this relation was mediated by students’ feeling of preparation. Finally, students also considered the provision of PPT handouts more valuable to their learning and course performance than one-to-one interactions with the professor.

It examines spoken, interactional data and written, representational data, each requiring different theoretical and methodological apparatus. The first component of the analysis employs the methodological framework of Conversation Analysis to examine the interactional work accomplished by Clinton’s laughter and other politicians in situ (i.e. in the interviews themselves). The second component employs an indexical approach to analyze the post-hoc recontextualization of Clinton’s laughter by mainstream media as a gendered representation, namely, as a ‘cackle’. Analyzing Clinton’s laughter in talk-in-interaction and its subsequent representation in talk-out-of-interaction reveals how communicative behavior that is not gendered by original participants may nevertheless become gendered by other participants.

"511",2008,"Journal of International Women's Studies","The female body in Margaret Atwood's The Edible Woman and Lady Oracle","This essay examines scholarly discourses about embodiment, and their increasing scholarly currency, in relation to two novels by the Canadian writer Margaret Atwood. Like many of Atwood's 'other works, The Edible Woman (1969) and Lady Oracle (1976) are explicitly concerned with the complexities of body image. More specifically, however, these novels usefully exemplify her attempt to demystify the female form. In the following pages, I investigate Atwood's treatment of the mind/body dualism and analyse the ways in which she responds to, and resists, its destructive effects. Using contemporary theory, moreover, I show how Atwood deals with the concept of female space, as well as the 'space' of the female body itself. I also consider Atwood's representation of the female appetite, taking into account its relationship to power and identity, and foregrounding the cultural meaning of eating disorders. Taken together, these subject matters demonstrate how the body 'feeds' identity and how a woman's corporeal experience directly influences her cultural experience. Through a close engagement with recent theories of embodiment, I analyse the extent to which Atwood's fiction might dismantle culturally-encoded concepts of femininity and propose a useful corrective to traditional readings of the female body in which the re-embodiment of the self is equated to a re-embodiment of culture.","2-s2.0-43149114484","United Kingdom"

In this paper, I examine how a group of young women and men living in Industrial Cape Breton - a disadvantaged Atlantic Canadian working-class community - negotiate the traditional gendered identities ascribed to them through local history with twenty-first-century conceptions of family and gender. Young adults in this study suggest that class-based and gender-based capital plays a significant role in how these changes are experienced by individuals, families, and communities. Furthermore, the social, economic, and psychological expenses for individuals attempting to secure economic comfort and gendered respectability in their disadvantaged communities leave little time and energy to critically reflect on the systemic social and economic conditions that enable class-based gender inequalities to thrive. As a result, traditional concepts of the masculine family 'breadwinner' and the feminine family 'caregiver' survive even as the societal basis for these roles is eroded by global capitalism. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-77951061079","Canada"

These experiences have caused each of us to reflect on our teaching practices within the classroom. When college professors receive disclosures from their students they have to develop strategies on how to effectively handle the disclosure, how to manage the classroom environment and assignments knowing that a survivor is in the course, and how to effectively handle their own emotional impact that may result from the disclosure.

This research investigated whether certain moral concerns contribute to men endorsing feminism. According to the moral foundations theory (MFT), there are five moral concerns: harm (i.e., the concern for someone's physical and emotional well-being), fairness (i.e., the concern for equality and justice), ingroup (i.e., the concern for loyalty to group membership), authority (i.e., the concern for tradition and the social hierarchy), and purity (i.e., the concern for physical and spiritual cleanliness; Graham et al., 2011). Graham, Haidt, and Nosek (2009) found that harm and fairness correlate to liberalism; therefore we predicted that men's feminism would be associated with an increased emphasis on those moral concerns and a decreased emphasis on ingroup, authority, and purity. Using an online survey methodology, participants were assessed on various aspects of feminism and morality. The results generally supported our predictions that higher support for conservative moral concerns correlates to less endorsement of feminism, whereas higher support for liberal moral concerns correlates to more endorsement of feminism, even when controlling for political ideology.

Dress advice consists of moments in which demands for immaterial labour find material translations into items of clothing. Building on ethnographic observations, I argue that dress advice-encounters should be seen as exercises in adaptability to new and ever changing economic circumstances. In these pedagogies, gender is a key instrument. Rather than a straightforward feminization of the economy, what is at stake is a performance of openness towards becoming adaptable to future labour market demands. Asking men to depart their attachments to Fordist working class masculinities and its material translations is an exercise toward becoming pliable enough for post-Fordist precarious labour markets. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Since the 1990s, the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in various contexts prompted a few Francophone North African writers to revisit Mohammed's life creatively. This article examines three historical novels about Mohammed: Assia Djebar's Loin de Médine (1991), Driss Chraïbi's L'homme du livre (1995) and Salim Bachi's Le silence de Mahomet (2008). When a writer embarks on such well-trodden ground that is the life of the Prophet Mohammed, what stands out are two elements: first, the liberties taken in terms of content from the accepted mainstream accounts of his life; and second, the narrative choices made by the writers to tell the story. This study situates these novels in the various contexts that prompted their writings, examines the convergences and divergences among Djebar's, Chraïbi's and Bachi's novels, paying particular attention to the implications of various content and form choices for their creative renderings of Mohammed's life. © 2013 Intellect Ltd.","2-s2.0-84903964770","United States"

Hypotheses derived from a dual-impact model of gender and career-related processes were tested in a 5-wave longitudinal study over a time span of 10 years starting with participants' career entry. In line with our hypotheses we found that the communal component of the gender self-concept had an impact on parenthood, and the agentic component influenced work hours and objective career success (salary, status) of both women and men. Parenthood had a negative direct influence on women's work hours and a negative indirect influence on women's objective career success. Women who had their first child around career entry were relatively least successful over the observation period. Men's career success was independent of parenthood. Sixty-five percent of variance in women's career success and 33% of variance in men's career success was explained by the factors analyzed here. Mothers with partners working full time reduced their work hours more than mothers with partners not working full time. A test for a possible reverse influence of career success on the decision to become a parent revealed no effect for men and equivocal effects for women. We conclude that the transition to parenthood still is a crucial factor for women's career development both from an external gender perspective (expectations, gender roles) and from an internal perspective (gender-related self-concept). © The Author(s) 2011.","2-s2.0-79960079951","Germany"

Data were examined from 224 self-identified bisexual women (M age = 22.79, SD = 3.44) who took part in an online survey.

A total of 48.0% of the sample (n = 108) experienced sexual coercion in the past 30 days. Sequential mediation indicated more experiences of binegativity were associated with greater drinking-to-cope motives, which in turn, related to greater alcohol frequency and greater likelihood of sexual coercion. Alcohol quantity was not a significant mediator. Results suggest the importance of studying the impact of binegativity on bisexual women, as well as developing prevention programs that consider how this form of discrimination may contribute to drinking-to-cope motives, more frequent alcohol use, and increased risk for sexual coercion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85059899318","United States"

Theft by women was typically an isolated act motivated by urban conditions of poverty, but many women became skilled repeat offenders who worked individually or in teams, taking advantage of the growing transportation networks that linked villages, towns, and cities. The theft examined includes shoplifting, pickpocketing, burglary, laundry stealing, scams, and stealing from domestic employers. Given their low wages, poor and working-class women had difficulty meeting their material needs in a semicolonial capitalist urban economy even when they worked in legal occupations. In addition, the legal work most available to them, in factories or as domestic servants, violated classed and gendered notions of respectability. Theft offered the possibility of material gain without great loss in status if one were captured, since poor and working-class women who lived in Egypt's growing cities between the two world wars already had difficulty measuring up to the standards of being mastura, a morally and sexually protected member of society. © 2017 by the Association for Middle East Women's Studies.","2-s2.0-85036549269","United States"

We argue that gender research and theory is insufficiently developed in both computational literary history and World Literature.

However, a review of previous studies shows that the relationship associated with gender difference, student perceptions and learning outcomes has still remained unexplored, and there has been little discussion regarding flipped classroom environment. To fill this gap, this study aimed to provide a further study by developing an empirical study, extending perspectives of research for flipped classroom in education. This study was conducted to respond and investigate two main student perceptions in a flipped precalculus course, namely, situational interest and course satisfaction. By the self-developed perception measures, situational interest contained feeling, value and topic interest (three factors), while course satisfaction contained course design, system quality, course arrangement and online assessment (four factors). To respectively determine factors on final grades, we assessed the predicting power among those factors. Students' feedback and gender differences were also evaluated to provide a holistic profile of this flipped course. Results showed that feelings predict the final grades in males, while course design predicts the final grades in females. Moreover, the result also showed that even if females and males showed different topic interest in this course, they performed equally well. Some suggestions to effectively implement a flipped course were also provided from students' feedback. The implications of the results were provided for instructors' guidance in implementing flipped classroom. Finally, the study concluded that students' perceptions may be considered as motivational strategies in teaching and learning process to involve students in academic activities for improving their grades in flipped course. © 2015 British Educational Research Association","2-s2.0-84927949098","Taiwan"
"535",2016,"Tourism","Cooking in tourism and at home: Unpacking the contours of different gender orders in Moreomaoto, Botswana","Cooking is an ancient human activity which has long been characterised through deep social expectations which are often gendered. However, in tourism where food represents one of the key attractions, the scholarship has not given enough attention to investigating how cooking involves hierarchical gendered power relations. This paper reports on fieldwork research conducted in Moreomaoto Village, Botswana. It was found that while cooking is undertaken in both Meno A Kwena, an ecotourism camp, and the homes in its neighbouring village, Moreomaoto, the discourses used to justify who does the work are similarly gendered. Namely, it is considered normal for women to cook, whether at the camp or at home, as it is what they have always done. Women capitalize on the idea that cooking at camp and at home is the same as a means of gaining access to employment opportunities. Men, however, are increasingly moving into cooking jobs at Meno A Kwena, despite them not cooking at home unless they 'have to' or 'feel like it'. This movement has been normalised as men are discursively constructed as capable cooks. As long as their cooking is taking place outside of the home and framed as different to that which is undertaken within the home, men are able to maintain the existing gender order. In a context that is increasingly characterised by environmental and financial fragility, being able to illustrate this type of adaptability means that men have been better able than women to diversify the tourism employment opportunities available to them.","2-s2.0-85011999787","South Africa"

While these videos are purportedly designed to promote a positive alternative to the technocratic and medical model of maternity, they do so by framing home-birth stories as self-made, masochistic narratives: mythic journeys depicting hardworking individual actors enduring pain to transform self and circumstance. Examining how textual and paratextual elements of the videos narrativize the birthing process, I explore their role in cultivating a masochistic subjective posture that rationalizes self-governance and subordinates opportunities for feminist systemic critique in favor of celebration of individual autonomy. After detailing the functions of birth stories as self-made narratives that reinforce dominant discourses of masochistic motherhood in a neoliberalist context that conditions mothers to self-renounce, self-deny, and sacrifice in order to be “good” citizens, I offer paths to a renewed structural critique with the potential to challenge dominant cultural logics of birth and mothering. © 2016, The Organization for Research on Women and Communication.","2-s2.0-84959345169","United States"

Such bans were often ignored, but both normative and anecdotal evidence from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries documents a number of sustained attempts at enforcement. This article summarizes interpretations given to such bans by historians and analyzes the parameters of enforcement. While all-out bans were rarely envisioned, because of the total lack of public support, some officials tried to curb certain types of female participation in temple life that were considered particularly offensive (ritual roles for women, staying overnight, spectacular penitential practices, and so forth). This article argues that while outright repression of women (jailing and punishing all women entering temples or joining festivals) or temples (closure or destruction) was difficult to maintain on a long-term basis, it might serve as a threat in negotiations between official and local elites. In the course of such negotiations, elite members agreed to try to curb some """" excessive"""" female practices in temples in exchange for official approval for temple festivals. © 2008 BRILL.""","2-s2.0-70149102094","France"

"541",2019,"Psychology of Women Quarterly","Mothers and Mental Labor: A Phenomenological Focus Group Study of Family-Related Thinking Work","Mental labor is an under-researched and long-invisible component of family work. Scholars have described mental labor as important, taxing, and disproportionately performed by mothers compared to fathers. However, operational definitions used in these studies were only preliminary and lack unified terminology. Answering calls for expanded views of household labor and better definitions of its content, we undertook a phenomenological investigation of family-related mental labor performed by mothers. Our interpretive phenomenological analysis of seven focus group interviews produced a definition of mothers’ mental labor and its component parts that was empirically grounded in the lived experience of mothers of young children (N = 25). Distinct from housework chores, childcare, and emotion work, mental labor emerged as thinking activity performed for the sake of accomplishing family goals. We identified six forms of mental labor: (a) planning and strategizing, (b) monitoring and anticipating needs, (c) metaparenting, (d) knowing (learning and remembering), (e) managerial thinking (including delegating and instructing), and (f) self-regulation. All participating mothers represented themselves as their family’s primary mental laborer, regardless of employment status or their partner’s level of involvement. Our description of mental labor may help parents, researchers, clinicians, policy makers, and educators recognize, value, and better account for the mental labor dynamics operating in the construction of family life, reproduction of gender roles, and perpetuation of gender gaps in family labor division and mental load.

Besides it is known that gender is a social construction (and not only determined by biological sex). Two basics social - cultural factors that shape the gender are dressing and fashion. A chorography (especially the last two centuries) shows these different constructions of masculinity and femininity. The battle for the use of trousers by women (from Coco Channel and stars of Hollywood Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and Katharine Hepburn play a significant role) confirm the different treatment of male and female. Fashion, which in essence is the fantasy of escape from the typical role of individuals, guiding and shaping the male and female roles, with the major fashion designers to play the key role in shaping it. Dress movements such as Macaroni (1760 - 1780), Baeu, (early 18th century), Dandies (early 19th century) and Mods (20th century) and various teen subcultures show differentiation trends of certain groups. Unisex style has tried to conceal gender differences showing a masquerade of equality for all (with the hippies and Ravers to have the basic role). On the contrary androgynous style seeks to unite the male and the female body, leading to a return to a primordial cosmic unity that will appease the gender confusion and anxiety.

Material from the movement's public discourse and participant observation and interviews in a local congregation are examined to explore how these Christians understand and practice fatherhood. Like evangelicals in the United States, Newfrontiers combine older ideas about responsible, breadwinner fatherhood with new concepts of emotionally involved fathering. Like American evangelicals, they aim to maintain biblical values while embracing contemporary culture in order to be relevant to society. What is noticeable is that despite the more traditional ideals their leaders advocate, evangelical congregations' fatherhood ideals and practices are very similar to those of mainstream U.K. society. Thus, the article concludes that mainstream culture is exercising a greater influence on British evangelicals than theology. © The Author(s) 2010.","2-s2.0-78650240122","United Kingdom"

German male and female students (N = 99) were surveyed at a German medical school (T1) and 15 years later (T2). Women interrupted their careers for longer than men (d=.92). Men had a substantially higher income at T2 (d=1.07). Career interruptions, agentic personality traits, and high school grades were significant predictors of salary for both sexes. High final grades at medical school were significantly and positively related to salary but only for men. Low final grades at medical school and number of children predicted the length of career interruptions. For women, number of children was significantly and positively related to career interruptions. For men, number of children was significantly but negatively related to career interruptions.

All news entries were probed to discern pervading gender stereotypes held regarding female and male artists. A subsequent online survey investigated any stereotypical depictions that had been identified. Administered to 120 respondents, this survey attempted to evaluate how representative views held throughout society were pervading gender stereotypes in media discourse. Results showed that female artists, as portrayed in the tabloids, were commonly associated with belligerence, money worship, and social pressures with respect to marriage and sexuality. By contrast, portrayals of male artists focused on personal defects in physical appearance and love affairs, and invariably involved manipulation of how the private lives of these artists were viewed. Most stereotypical depictions were further shown to be highly defined beliefs shared among the survey respondents.

The current research compared how male and female students perceived mobile phones as a language learning tool, used mobile phones to learn English and developed their learning performance. A five-point rating scale questionnaire was used to collect data from 122 students, comprising 65 females and 57 males. They were enrolled in a fundamental English course where mobile phone usage was integrated in certain language learning tasks with an aim to facilitate learning. The findings demonstrated that male and female students did not differ in their usage, attitudes toward mobile phone uses for language learning as well as their learning performance at a significance level. In addition, the constraints of using mobile phone for learning that students identified in an open-ended question included the small screen and keyboard the most, followed by intrusiveness of SMS background knowledge, and limited memory of mobile phone. The implication for classroom practice was proposed in how mobile phone can be fully incorporated into the instructional process in order to enhance learner engagement. The results of this study are important for teachers when implementing the mobile phone technology in language teaching.

To date, however, little is known about the socio-economic origins and gender composition of the very top tail in the modern era. This paper takes a first step in filling some of the holes in our knowledge. We use a tax-filer data base for Canada for the period 1983-2003 that contains about eighty million observations. We show first that male earners in the top one thousandth of the distribution come very disproportionately from families with incomes in the top decile. In contrast, individuals in the remaining part of the top centile have more dispersed socio-economic origins. Second we show that female participation in the top fractiles has been very low, and that growth in participation has been slow yet definite. In contrast, female earnings in this echelon are almost on par with male earnings. Third, we show that there is an enormous asymmetry between the genders when it comes to spousal earnings: high-earning women have very high-earning spouses, but not vice versa. 'Secondary males' have earnings levels almost ten times as high as 'secondary females', suggesting that, even at this extremely elevated earnings level there is truth to the adage about who lies 'behind' successful individuals. Finally, it is illustrated that the earnings concentration that has characterised the last three decades did not change with the end of the 'tech boom' in the year 2000.","2-s2.0-33749017331","Canada"
"553",2018,"Psychology of Women Quarterly","“I’m Not a Science Nerd!”: STEM Stereotypes, Identity, and Motivation Among Undergraduate Women","Stereotypes reduce women’s identification with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), which can decrease their motivation to enter STEM domains. Stereotypes may be gender-based (e.g., STEM is for men) or trait-based (e.g., STEM is for geniuses). In this study, I explored two primary research questions: First, would stereotyping STEM as a domain for nerdy geniuses negatively relate to women’s STEM identity? Second, would STEM identity mediate the relation between stereotypes and STEM motivation? Nerd-genius stereotypes and gender stereotypes negatively contributed to women’s STEM identity. STEM identity positively contributed to women’s STEM motivation (including expectancy-value beliefs). Participants were a diverse sample of undergraduate women (N = 195, mean age was 19.8; 30% of participants were Latina, 30% European, 24% Asian). Stereotype measures were (1) implicit gender-STEM associations, (2) explicit gender associations about STEM, and (3) a new scale that measured nerd-genius stereotypes. The results highlight the unique contribution different stereotypes make toward women’s identification with STEM and, in turn, their motivation to pursue STEM pathways. Practice implications include addressing nerd-genius stereotypes in STEM interventions and reducing classroom artifacts that might be reminiscent of these stereotypes. © The Author(s) 2018.","2-s2.0-85052567714","United States"

Female patients with schizophrenia are less impaired in social life than male patients. Because social impairment in schizophrenia has been found to be associated with deficits in emotion recognition, we examined whether the female advantage in processing emotional prosody and semantics is preserved in schizophrenia. Method. Forty-eight patients (25 males, 23 females) and 46 controls (23 males, 23 females) were assessed using an emotional language task (in which healthy women generally outperform healthy men), consisting of 96 sentences in four conditions: (1) neutral-content/emotional-tone (happy, sad, angry or anxious); (2) neutral-tone/emotional-content; (3) emotional-tone/ incongruous emotional-content; and (4) emotional-content/incongruous emotional-tone. Participants had to ignore the emotional-content in the third condition and the emotional-tone in the fourth condition. In addition, participants were assessed with a visuospatial task (in which healthy men typically excel). Correlation coefficients were computed for associations between emotional language data, visuospatial data, IQ measures and patient variables. Results. Overall, on the emotional language task, patients made more errors than control subjects, and women outperformed men across diagnostic groups. Controlling for IQ revealed a significant effect on task performance in all groups, especially in the incongruent tasks. On the rotation task, healthy men outperformed healthy women, but male patients, female patients and female controls obtained similar scores. Conclusion. The advantage in emotional prosodic and semantic processing in healthy women is preserved in schizophrenia, whereas the male advantage in visuospatial processing is lost.

Co-authoring stories is a chief tool by which feminists working in alliances across borders mobilize experience to write against relations of power that produce social violence, and to imagine and enact their own visions and ethics of social change. Such work demands a serious engagement with the complexities of identity, representation, and political imagination as well as a rethinking of the assumptions and possibilities associated with engagement and expertise. This article draws upon 16 years of partnership with activists in India and with academic co-authors in the USA to reflect on how storytelling across social, geographical, and institutional borders can enhance critical engagement with questions of violence and struggles for social change, while also troubling dominant discourses and methodologies inside and outside of the academy. In offering five 'truths' about co-authoring stories through alliance work, it reflects on the labor process, assumptions, possibilities, and risks associated with co-authorship as a tool for mobilizing intellectual spaces in which stories from multiple locations in an alliance can speak with one another and evolve into more nuanced critical interventions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84874322889","United States"

The first half of this study focuses on the context, practices and working conditions of the Thai sex tourism industry. This is then used as the lens through which to analyse the approaches to Thai sex tourism in Western mainstream literature. Four books were analysed for their depiction of Thai prostitutes, with a focus on the plots, themes and characterisations of the women they depicted. Troublingly, it was found that the fiction often dismissed or glossed over the problems faced by Thai prostitutes, going so far as to glamourise the profession and demonise the women. Conversely, the non-fiction works are less romanticised and provided more nuanced and complex pictures of the women working in prostitution. It is important that this dichotomy is addressed. The fictional works serve to perpetuate myths and negative stereotypes about the industry and the women who work in it, ultimately contributing to their further subjugation by normalising sex tourism. © 2015 Journal of International Women's Studies.","2-s2.0-84938913520","Australia"

Participants were randomly selected from high schools and completed the Adolescent Stress Questionnaire (ASQ), the Self-Efficacy Questionnaire for Children and the Adolescent Alcohol Involvement Scale (AAIS). The results showed that girls had significantly higher mean scores on seven out of ten stress domains. Females also scored significantly lower on self-esteem, and social self-efficacy (SSE), but higher on emotional self-efficacy. Regression analyses showed differential relationships between self-efficacy domains and stress domains. Moreover, tests of interaction effects revealed that these relationships were invariant both for gender and for levels of self-esteem; in other words, neither gender nor self-esteem moderated the relationship between adolescent stress and self-efficacy. Additional analyses revealed that moderating effects of self-efficacy domains on the relationship between stress domains and alcohol use were infrequent.

Their commitment to a flawed paradoxical approach has forced many sex workers to provide their services in ways that increase their risk of being victimized. To date, there is little published research on how adult male sex workers understand and work around the law relating to sex work. In an effort to address this void, we present the views of 19 adult male escorts on two related issues: (1) the ambiguity of the criminal law relating to their trade and its enforcement; and (2) the use of strategies to cope with the dangers posed by the current legal climate. We show that although adult male escorts misunderstood the law, their comprehension of and experience with its enforcement gave them the impression that they must take precautionary measures to decrease their risk of being charged with a criminal offence and/or victimized by clients or the police. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84898547379","Canada"

I argue that the widely circulated insistence by critics and readers of Bâ's epistolary style novel on the practice of Islam in West Africa, particularly in Senegal, as a syncretic presence eagerly adapting to indigenous non-Islamic beliefs and practice, has led to an overly generalized and somewhat inaccurate perception of Islam in Africa. Through my reading of some key Islamic concepts described in Bâ's novel, such as the mirath, polygamy, prayer and sunna, I situate my reading of Ramatoulaye's expression of Islamic feminism within an African and Islamic feminist reading and further position these within the cultural context of the practice of Islam in Senegal. By her 'strategic self-positioning', as defined by Islamic feminist Miriam Cooke, among others, within a small group of Senegalese Muslims - locally known as ibadu Muslims - Ramatoulaye succeeds in enacting Islamic feminism in her spiritual persistence for a strict adherence to the Qur'an and in her resistance to the temptation to expand the Islamic precepts of her faith. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-70649092377","United States"
"566",2006,"Sexualities","Gay parenthood and the decline of paternity as we knew it","Most analyses of postmodern transformations of intimacy feature adult unions, often placing gays and lesbians on the frontier. The contemporary pursuit of parenthood evinces a similar shift from obligation to desire and from an economic to an emotional calculus. Here too, gay men and lesbians serve as pioneers, with planned gay male parenthood occupying particularly avant-garde terrain and Los Angeles County. This article analyzes gay male narratives of parental desire and decision-making drawn from ethnographic research on gay male intimacy and kinship in Los Angeles, the unlikely global epicenter of gay paternity. It identifies a 'passion for parenthood' continuum in which most men occupy an intermediate zone which leads them to situational paternity or childlessness contingent upon intimate relationships. Heterosexual 'situations' lead most straight men to paternity, while homosexual 'situations' lead a majority of gay men to childlessness. Yet the very success gay men achieve pursuing parenthood against enormous odds exposes conditions governing contemporary family life that represent the decline of paternity as we knew it. This does not augur the demise of male parenthood, however, but its creative, if controversial, reconfiguration. Copyright © 2006 SAGE Publications.","2-s2.0-33646257819","United States"

This article presents a de novo analysis of these experiments, focusing on two core issues that have received limited attention in previous analyses: treatment effect heterogeneity by gender and overrejection of the null hypothesis due to multiple inference. To address the latter issue, a statistical framework that combines summary index tests with familywise error rate and false discovery rate corrections is implemented. The first technique reduces the number of tests conducted; the latter two techniques adjust the p values for multiple inference. The primary finding of the reanalysis is that girls garnered substantial short- and long-term benefits from the interventions, but there were no significant long-term benefits for boys.

"568",2019,"Geoforum","The gender of debt and space: Notes from Ramallah-Al Bireh, Palestine","This paper argues that space is crucial to understanding intersections of gender and debt, and the gender of debt as a concept. Drawing on existing accounts of gender and debt, and ethnographic research in the Palestinian conurbation of Ramallah Al Bireh, we argue that articulations of gender, debt and space can be examined through practices of becoming indebted, managing debt and ‘wearing’ debt. In Ramallah, home spaces play a particularly important role as an expensive commodity that is forcing an increasing number of (usually male) residents to become indebted, a context through which debts are managed (usually by women), and an active co-constituent of debt through interiority, and the privacy this affords (unequally distributing the emotional, embodied labour of living with debt). In conclusion, we turn to the gender of debt to think through the intersections of postcolonial and gendered difference, and argue for decentring the Eurocentric bias of existing conceptualisations of debt and finance. This contributes to work examining the active role geographies play in constituting debts, both in practice and in theory. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85047084090","R."

Method: This cross-sectional analysis included 914 adults with diabetes who completed the Health and Retirement Study's 2003 Mail Survey on Diabetes. IRDSS is a composite score of 8 diabetes self-care measures. Hemoglobin A1c levels were obtained to measure good glycemic control (<8.0%). Gender-stratified multivariate log-binomial regression models were used to estimate prevalence ratios and examine the association between IRDSS and glycemic control after controlling for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. Results: The prevalence of good glycemic control was 48.9% among women and 51.1% among men. Mean composite IRDSS scores did not differ by gender. Among women, composite IRDSS was associated with adequate glycemic control (prevalence ratio: 1.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.02, 1.08), and all individual components of IRDSS, with the exception of keeping appointments, were positively associated with adequate glycemic control. No significant associations were observed in men for composite or individual components of IRDSS. Discussion: Determining the gender-specific impact derived from IRDSS is a worthwhile approach to highlighting factors that differentially predict optimal glycemic control among middle-aged and older adults. © 2015 The Author.

"573",2017,"GLQ","The new normative: Gay fatherhood on israeli television","Over the past decade, LGBT figures have become increasingly visible on Israeli television in its various channels and genres, especially cis-gendered gay men. In recent years, however, the representation of gay people on Israeli television has undergone a considerable shift, whereby many television texts feature gay men as fathers. These texts usually present gay parenthood as a positive phenomenon and sometimes even as more successful than heteronormative parenthood. The recasting of gay parenthood as positive is achieved through various devices, some of which are familiar from other places around the world, while others touch on unique features of Jewish-Israeli reality. In this article, I lay out the various strategies through which gay fatherhood is recast as positive on Israeli television and present the possible costs of this positive (and normative) representation of gay fatherhood. I focus on the television serial drama Ima VeAbbaz (Mom and Dads), whose protagonists are two gay men who have a child with a straight woman. I argue that the show manages to deviate from the usual representation of the gay father, thereby offering an ideological alternative to conventional and conservative (even if accepting) perspectives on gay parenting. © 2017 by Duke University Press.","2-s2.0-85030700127","Israel"

Using the actor-partner interdependence model, path analyses revealed that women's submissive behavior had negative links to personal sexual satisfaction and their partner's sexual satisfaction but only when their submission was inconsistent with their sexual preferences.

Design/methodology/approach – Aliterature review examines business advisory services and risk aversion from a gender perspective. The empirical data are derived from interviews with owners of more than 2,700 start-ups and young companies in Sweden.Anumber of key variables compare how the company owners (women and men) view business advisory services as a way to overcome risk and to gain access to information in networks. Several statistical tests are used to analyse these data. Findings – Women owners of start-ups and young companies use more and different business advisory services than men owners. There are differences among the men owners and women owners with regard to the amount of start-up capital, company size and industry sector. Given the risks associated with start-up, business advisory services are important to women in helping them reduce their risk in the start-up and early stages of their companies. Research limitations/implications – Companies in Sweden’s largest city, Stockholm, were not included in the sample. Financial data were not used as variables. Practical implications – Policymakers should address women owners’ greater demand for business advisory services in their companies’ early stages.

Although research widely demonstrates effects of gender bias on other motivational processes, whether gender bias directly affects feelings of interest toward science activities is unknown. We used a false feedback paradigm to manipulate whether women (Study 1) and men (Study 2) participants perceived the reason for feedback as due to pro-male bias. Because activity interest also depends on how students approach and perform the activity, effects of biased feedback on interest appraisals were isolated by introducing gender bias only after the science activity was completed. When the feedback was perceived as due to pro-male bias, women (Study 1) reported lower interest and men (Study 2) reported greater interest in the science activity, and interest, in turn, positively predicted subsequent requests for career information in both studies.

This case study examines how a series of local television news stories about a campus sexual assault scandal exemplifies both progress and persistent problems as defined by the critical feminist literature. Drawing on a framing analysis of the nine-story series, including a semi-structured interview with the key journalist, I argue that progressive possibilities arose from the pairing of a feminist journalist with resources afforded by investigative reporting. Many of those possibilities were exploited to produce progressive framing, especially when they served both feminist values and market-driven news values. Adherence to a single news narrative guided by the news value of conflict sometimes mitigated prospects for feminist framing, though, preventing adequate attention to the role social structures play in causing and justifying sexual assault. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-61249384509","United States"

"581",2018,"Sex Roles","Female Leadership and Role Congruity within the Clergy: Communal Leaders Experience No Gender Differences Yet Agentic Women Continue to Suffer Backlash","Role congruity theory predicts that female leaders will experience prejudice because the role of leader aligns more closely with the stereotypic male gender role than it does with the stereotypic female role. Yet the theory also states that the context of leadership matters. Female leaders in communal contexts often do not experience prejudice because the communal role is congruent to the female role. The purpose of my study is to examine female leadership within the context of the religious congregation and the profession of the clergy. Using multilevel models to analyze Wave 2 of the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (50,595 congregants in 255 congregations), I tested two competing hypotheses about whether the role of clergyperson is congruous or incongruous for women based on congregants’ perceptions of their leaders. I also hypothesized that female clergy using a more masculine leadership style would experience more prejudice. Results offer support for the hypothesis that female clergy experience role congruity, yet, I also found that they experience prejudice if they use a more masculine leadership style. These findings have implications that suggest that, even though there are behavioral restrictions for women, the profession of clergy is an amenable profession for female leaders. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-85021829365","United States"
"582",2018,"European Journal of Population","Intentions to Live Together Among Couples Living Apart: Differences by Age and Gender","One of the central questions about LAT (living apart together) is whether these partnerships are short-term arrangements due to temporary constraints, and should be viewed as part of courtship towards cohabitation and marriage, or whether they replace cohabitation and marriage as a long-term arrangement. The current study addresses this question and examines intentions to live together among people living apart by age and gender. This study uses Generations and Gender Study (GGS) data for eleven European countries. The findings reveal an interesting interaction of age and gender. More specifically, younger women have higher intentions to live together than younger men, but older women have lower intentions than older men. These gender differences remain significant also in the multivariate analyses. These findings suggest that older women in LAT may be undoing gender to a greater extent than younger women, who still intend to live in a more traditional (and probably gendered) arrangement of cohabitation and possibly marriage. Having resident children reduces intentions to live together among people younger than age 50, but the effect does not differ by gender.

This paper examines experiences of gender integration of South African Navy ships through the use of symbols of military culture. Accounts from female and male sailors were collected through interviews and focus groups, 18 months after the gender integration of their ships, and revealed the symbolic use of rituals, metaphors, artefacts and physical space. Military organisations typically do not allow deviations from either their hegemonic masculine orientation, or official gender-supportive policies. To express either resistance or acceptance of gender integration, sailors used accepted (naval) cultural symbolism to covertly communicate and enforce their relative positions. Rituals were used as expression of inclusion and to communicate organisational norms, while metaphors reflected the ambivalence in the fleet. Further, as metaphors were constructed from familiar images, they served to regulate interaction in novel situations. Uniforms acted as organisational artefacts of oppression and resistance to women. The use of corporate space acquired different meanings, of both resistance and acceptance, within the context of gender integration of naval ships. The paper concludes by discussing some issues that arose from both the descriptive and prescriptive use of these symbols - in particular for the expression and maintenance of identity, and for the regulation of behaviour in unfamiliar situations.","2-s2.0-48349145229","South Africa"

"591",2019,"Signs","Voices from the inside: Lived experiences of women confined in a detention center","Drawing on two years of fieldwork, this article focuses on the lived experiences of women detained inside Rome’s Identification and Expulsion Center, the main migration-related detention facility in Italy. We employed a thematic narrative analysis to examine the narratives of five women with different life trajectories in order to identify continuities and discontinuities within and across their stories. This analysis reveals that women’s experiences of oppression and agency in their countries of origin, transit, and settlement are deeply intertwined and strongly influenced by structural forces. Gender and sexuality, in relation to other hierarchies of power such as class, race, and nationality, profoundly shape such experiences, becoming crucial in the production of women as excludable and deportable subjects. Further, as the accounts of our participants lay bare, the immigration control system appears to play a key role in the (re)production of a dominant normative order. However, women are not passive spectators of the violence to which they are forcibly exposed. Rather, they struggle to cope with and resist the regimes of power that oppress their everyday lives. Through a feminist stance, this contribution seeks to enrich the body of scholarship on the lived experiences of women subject to practices of immigration and border control, particularly those confined in detention centers. Moreover, it highlights the need for a feminist project based on the creation of political and affective alliances across borders and axes of difference, particularly those related to legally produced statuses. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

Keeping in mind the reality of data scarcity that show male and female differences in mortality, this paper uses life expectancy data to illustrate the widening gender inequalities in access to health. The analysis in the paper addresses two main objectives. First, the paper reviews the literature on the underlying factors behind the presence of drastic differences between male and female life expectancies. Secondly, the paper examines in greater detail the trends and geographical patterns in life expectancy in southern African countries, particularly the reversal of life expectancy in favor of men during the past 30 years or so. The results of the analysis show a worrisome trend in life expectancies with regard to gender. The advantage in life expectancy that females had over men before 1980 has all but disappeared during the past 25 years. To make matters worse, life expectancy declined dramatically for both males and females, and in some cases the declines were more than 10 years. Women experienced greater declines in life expectancy lowering them to below those of men, a condition contrary to what existed before the 1980s. The upsurge in HIV infections and the attendant high female mortality rates as well as other factors have combined to result in the unequal gender realities in as far as life expectancies are concerned in the countries of southern Africa. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","2-s2.0-84865439457","United States"

HIV testing should be routinely recommended if a woman presents with certain gynecologic conditions or sexually transmitted diseases. Lack of awareness of HIV status leads to the majority of new sexually transmitted HIV infections.

The full implications of gender differences in viral load and CD4 count in the treatment of women with HIV are not yet known. Clinical trial data on HIV therapies in women are limited, and most studies that have included women have not been powered to detect gender differences in virologic and immunologic success rates.

"595",2013,"Psychology, Crime and Law","Perceptions of male victim blame in a child sexual abuse case: Effects of gender, age and need for closure","According to the gender stereotypes attributed to men, and research on adult male victims, boys subjected to sexual abuse are expected to be better able to defend themselves than girls, and are thought to be more likely to adopt a proactive attitude in the victim-perpetrator relationship. They are consequently regarded as more blameworthy than female victims. In the present study, 384 French respondents read through a sexual abuse scenario in which the child victim's gender, perpetrator's gender and victim's age (7 vs. 12 years old) were manipulated. As expected, male respondents blamed the victim more than female respondents did, especially when the victim was a boy. Furthermore, male respondents blamed the perpetrator less than female respondents did, especially when the perpetrator was a woman and the victim a boy. However, these effects were observed for victims of both 7 and 12 years old while it was expected only for the 12-year-old victims. Finally, as expected, respondents who expressed a high need for closure perceived the victim as less credible and more guilty than respondents who expressed a low need for closure, particularly when the victim was 12 years old. This cognitive characteristic thus appears to moderate the expression of stereotypical representations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84884481600","United States"

"597",2013,"Equality, Diversity and Inclusion","Traditional and contemporary status of women in the patriarchal belt","Purpose - This paper aims to present a meta-analysis of available statistical data and literature for gender-related practices concerning women in business and education across countries, comparing the patriarchal belt and South Asian countries in the belt to the rest of the world. The purpose of the project is to investigate the progress of enhancement of opportunities for women to engage in non-agricultural work in the belt, and, as women's participation in tertiary education is touted as an impetus in enhancing women's opportunities, investigate its effect. Design/methodology/approach - The existence of a belt of countries from North Africa through Bangladesh and rural China is well known, with societies demonstrating a consistent pattern of restriction and suppression of women. No development of theory treating the patriarchal belt as a whole has been published. The authors earmark this as a future endeavour. They employ ten years of statistical summaries of percent of women in the non-agricultural labour force and ratios of women to men in tertiary education provided by the United Nations in support of the UN Millennium Development Goals to compare changes in these activities in countries in the patriarchal belt, South Asia, and the rest of the world. The method is to carry out statistical comparisons of trends derived from annual averages for the two measures. Findings - The literature review indicates that for millennia in the patriarchal belt societal practices have institutionalised women's lack of access to participation in the labour market and generally from participating in much of public life. The analyses indicate that participation in non-agricultural employment has decreased over the past decade in the belt compared to the rest of the world. Opportunities for women to participate in tertiary education have on average been increasing during this period for most countries of the world including those in the patriarchal belt. However, this circumstance has not led to increased participation in the non-agricultural work force. Practical implications - The practical implications seen are that the UN Millennium Development Goals (UNMDG) are important to improving the lot of individuals, some goals that purport to lead to improvements in human and gender rights in regions such as the patriarchal belt may have no real effect, and other, more useful goals need to be investigated. Economically, the exclusion of women from voluntary productive labour as detrimental to the development of a nation is seen. Social implications - In the patriarchal belt societal practices institutionalise negative discrimination concerning women, often codified in laws that prohibit women from participating in much of public life or fully competing in the labour market. The evaluation of these conditions using European and North American standards proposes that these women are abused and denied their rights. Nonetheless, initiatives such as agreements on the UNMDG appear to have no effect, and other solutions need to be pursued. Originality/value - The originality and value of this paper is that it investigates the complete set of patriarchal belt countries, across countries that include both Muslim and Hindu majorities. It concludes that while religions tenets are employed to justify patriarchal practices, long-standing tribal practices appear to be far more influential. © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

"598",2009,"Gender, Work and Organization","Seducing leadership: Stories of leadership development","This article argues that leadership development is a process of seduction. Drawing on some stories of leadership development from my experience as participant, observer and teacher I show the ways in which certain sorts of highly valued leadership teaching contain seductive elements, including sweeping audiences off their feet and, in some contexts, forestalling critique about the content that is offered. The article also considers the extent to which seduction is a gendered performance. I conclude that, while gender and power are defining elements and constraints in how seductive pedagogical relations are constructed, there are opportunities for experimentation and display that potentially subvert gendered stereotypes. Seeing the seduction in leadership can help us understand leadership and leadership teaching better, and can open the way to doing it differently - to experimentation and innovation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-68749107225","Australia"

This paper aims to identify and analyse if levels of personal motivation and flow are drivers of commitment, and if the relationship between the variables is moderated by length of service, age and gender. Design/methodology/approach: The study is a large-scale empirical investigation of hospitality staff in the UK branded restaurants through 1,133 survey responses, measuring levels of personal motivation, flow and commitment, as well as the moderating effects of multi-group differences among age, gender and length of service. Partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is used for analysis of data. Findings: Using PLS-SEM found personal motivation to be important in determining employees’ level of flow and, in turn, employees’ commitment. Using multi group analysis, results revealed that relationship among personal motivation, flow and commitment played superior role for older employees and working for a long time in a hospitality organisation than those younger and working less than five years. No significant differences between male and female staff are found. Research limitations/implications: Through finding flow and personal motivations to be drivers of commitment, branded restaurant practitioners can focus on emphasising these elements in their employees to increase commitment. Further, part-time roles are often taken by people likely to be non-committal in their job needs, e.g. students funding their studies. By focussing on extending lengths of service to meet the optimum years identified, managers can fortify their businesses. Originality/value: The paper is one of few large-scale quantitative studies to examine personal motivation, flow and commitment in the context of UK branded restaurants. It identifies that employees exhibit higher levels of commitment through intrinsic values over time, and establishes relationships between the constructs of flow, personal motivation and commitment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85046081301","United Kingdom"

"603",2017,"Men and Masculinities","Suicide: Why Are Older Men So Vulnerable?","Globally, older adults have higher suicide rates than other age-groups. However, it is predominantly men who die of suicide in late adulthood, with variability by culture. In the United States, European-descent men are overrepresented among suicide decedents. In this article, theories and evidence about aging adversities, individual dispositions, and cultural influences were evaluated for their potential to explain the suicide vulnerability of European-descent older men. Aging adversities were not found to account for these men’s suicide proneness. European-descent older men are exposed to less severe aging adversities than older women or ethnic-minority men—though they may be more impacted by them. Rigidity in coping and in sense of self, consistent with hegemonic-masculinity scripts, emerged as individual-level clues. The indignities-of-aging and the masculinity-of-suicide scripts may be cultural influences. This analysis shows how consideration of masculinities and suicide scripts expands our understanding of older men’s suicide as well as, likely, our tools for its prevention. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","2-s2.0-85015720386","United States"

The results suggest that CDMS vary between cultures and genders, thus it is essential for marketers and consumer behaviorists to consider them separately. Differences were found between cultures in enjoyment, shopping aversion, price consciousness and quality consciousness CDMS. Genders show divergence between enjoyment, shopping aversion and brand consciousness.

I find that subjects evaluate a candidate whose competence is in doubt less favorably, and are less likely to vote for the candidate, when she is a woman. In general, evaluations of women seem to be influenced much more by information related to their competence than are evaluations of men. I also find that competence as portrayed by the composition of a candidate’s facial features does not alter this relationship.

The women reported significantly higher personal autonomy and life satisfaction while living in Canada relative to Pakistan. Linear regression analyses indicated that living with in-laws was associated with lower life satisfaction in Pakistan but this was fully mediated by autonomy. More autonomy was also related to higher life satisfaction in Canada, but not to living arrangements or any other measured variable.

This study aimed at investigating whether neural responses to perceptually “invisible” emotional stimuli differ between men and women by exploiting event-related potential (ERP). Forty healthy participants (21 women) were recruited for the main experiment. A control experiment was conducted by excluding nine (7 women) participants from the main experiment and replacing them with additional ten (6 women) participants (total 41 participants) where Beck’s Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were controlled. Using the visual backward masking paradigm, either a fearful or a neutral face stimulus was presented in varied durations (subthreshold, near-threshold, or suprathreshold) followed by a mask. Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) emotion discrimination task on each face. Behavioral analysis showed that participants were unaware of masked stimuli of which duration was the shortest and, therefore, processed at subthreshold. Nevertheless, women showed significantly larger response in P100 amplitude to subthreshold fearful faces than men. This result remained consistent in the control experiment. Our findings indicate gender-differences in neural response to subthreshold emotional face, which is reflected in the early processing stage. ï¿½ 2017 Lee, Kim, Shimand Lee.","2-s2.0-85012072478","South Korea"

This article extends this body of research for the specific case of gender anthropomorphism by proposing a gender-schema congruity effect. Specifically, the results of two experimental studies demonstrated that when a human gender schema is primed, that is, congruent with consumers' own gender, consumers show more preferential evaluations and are more likely to perceive the product as human, even when no product-schema congruent features are present in the product.

These sites occupied distinct positions within a complex political economic landscape, and their charcoal assemblages reflect heterogeneity in household production.

"613",2018,"Men and Masculinities","Perceptions of Traditional Male Circumcision among University Male Students at a South African University","In the past decade, traditional male circumcision, known as ulwaluko among the Xhosa-speaking people in the Eastern Cape Province, has become a burning issue in South Africa. The discourse has led to the emergence of two opposing camps: the supporters of ulwaluko who rely on “traditional ideology” to justify the cultural relevance of the practice, and the opposing camp who believe that ulwaluko is no longer in tandem with the reality of the twenty-first century. Amid the ongoing debate, this study investigated the perceptions of ulwaluko among South African university students at the University of Fort Hare, South Africa. Open-ended individual interviews were conducted among nine male students at the university. The study relied on “hegemonic masculinity” as the theoretical framework. The study revealed mixed feelings about the ulwaluko ritual among the students interviewed. In spite of the exposure to modernization and Western education, the students interviewed were still emotionally and culturally attached to ulwaluko, especially as a rite of passage. While some doubted the ability of the ritual to change “bad boys” into “good boys,” virtually all the participants believed that morbidity and mortality recorded during and after ulwaluko were not sufficient grounds to abolish it. This finding suggests ulwaluko may have, over the years, consciously or unconsciously, constructed an idealized masculine identity that is morally upright, faced with challenges to the ritual and burdened by a prescriptive set of masculine role expectations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-85038425419","South Africa"

We hypothesize that the proportion of women directors, the proportion of independent, institutional, and executive female directors, and the percentage of shares held by female directors on BD, have an impact on the dividends policy of Spanish companies. Our findings, analyzing the whole sample, show that the proportion of female directors and shares held by female directors are positively associated with dividend payout, while the percentage of institutional female directors has a negative impact. The percentage of independent and executive female directors has no effect on dividend payout. When companies with losses are removed from the sample, the findings report that the percentage of female directors on BD and the percentage of independent female directors impact positively on dividend policy, while the percentage of institutional and executive female directors has a negative effect. The proportion of shares held by female directors on BD does not have an effect on dividend payout when only companies with profits are examined. Thus, the results confirm that gender diversity has an influence on dividend payout, so the existing legislation should encourage more participation by women in governing bodies.

Yet her position at San Francesco remains equivocal. As a New Testament saint, she logically functions as a model for St. Francis. His vita, however, anachronistically transforms her life, inspiring new narrative episodes—for example, her receipt of a gar-ment—or reshaping established scenes, as at her conversion when demons fly from her submissive body toward the very altar where Francis exorcised sinners. Despite being honored in her chapel, she consistently appears needy, a passive recipient of charity and miraculous works, rather than a miracle worker. As a female, she carries the taint of sexual sin through her exposed and eroticized body; she thus needs to be clothed by a hermit, as elsewhere at San Francesco destitute individuals are clothed by Saints Francis and Martin. A terrible sinner, she is exorcised by Christ, just as Francis posthumously exorcises pilgrims visiting his nearby tomb. And as Christ is honored by the Magdalen’s submissive washing of his feet, so Francis is honored by the humble simpleton. Not obviously a miracle-working saint, Mary Magdalen remains like the Assisi pilgrims petitioning for assistance. Yet her power as intercessor remains unchallenged as her very weaknesses offer audiences hope: if she can be saved, so can they. © 2019 by the International Center of Medieval Art.

Drawing from these sources, assertive strategies were operationalized as involving attempts to isolate women, to compete with other men, and to tease or insult women. The present investigation examined whether hostile and benevolent sexism and sociosexuality, the degree to which individuals require closeness and commitment prior to engaging in sex, were associated with the reported use of assertive strategies by men and the reported positive reception to those strategies by women. It was predicted men and women who were more sexist and had an unrestricted sociosexuality would report using more and being more receptive to assertive strategies. Study 1 (N = 363) surveyed a Midwestern undergraduate college student sample, and regression results indicated that sociosexuality was associated with assertive strategy preference and use, but sexism only predicted a positive reception of assertive strategies by women. Study 2 (N = 850) replicated these results by surveying a larger, national U. S. volunteer sample via the internet.

"624",2007,"Applied Economics Letters","Sources of gender wage gap in different economic sectors: The Israeli case","The purpose of the article is to examine the importance of personal characteristics vs. the importance of human capital returns in explaining the existing gender wage gap in different economic sectors in Israel. Using simulations on Israeli census data for 1983 and 1995, the analysis predicts women's wages in two cases. The first case predicts a woman's wages if she had the same personal characteristics as a man, and the second case predicts a woman's wages if she had the same human capital returns. By comparing the two predicted gender wage gaps to the existing gender wage gap, we can learn about the dominant explanation for the existing gender wage gap. The results show that the gender wage gap in all economic sectors stems mainly from differences in gender returns rather than differences in gender characteristics. Moreover, in the products sector and the low-services sector, the gender wage gap would have been larger if women had the same characteristics as men.","2-s2.0-36048984173","Israel"
"625",2017,"Psychology of Men and Masculinity","Does trait masculinity relate to expressing toughness? The effects of masculinity threat and self-affirmation in college men","Men have higher morbidity and mortality rates than women across the life span. One potential explanation for this gap is greater pressure for men to express their masculine toughness. Situations that threaten masculinity often result in compensatory behaviors (e.g., binge drinking) geared toward proving toughness. The present research tested the hypothesis that threats to masculinity would lead men to behave in ways that express toughness to a greater extent if they were highly masculine, as measured by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory. Further, we anticipated that self-affirmation would ameliorate the compensatory responding exhibited by higher masculine men under threat. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental cells in a 2 (Masculine Identity Threat: yes, no) × 2 (Self-Affirmation: yes, no) between-subjects factorial design. Results indicated that men expressed masculine toughness to a greater extent when facing a masculinity threat than when under no threat. Further, higher masculinity amplified the effect of threat in expressing toughness. Results also showed that the opportunity to self-affirm reduced expression of toughness among higher masculine men facing a masculinity threat. Theoretical contributions, implications, and future directions for this line of research are discussed. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","2-s2.0-84974588948","United States"

Understanding Frank Ocean and The Weeknd’s representations of gender","With the emergence of alternative R&B, contemporary R&B and hip hop culture are being confronted with a subgenre that challenges its key characteristics. One of the aspects that typify alternative R&B is the emergence of an alternative masculinity. The aim of this study is to research whether the alternative masculinities represented in alternative R&B resist the hegemonic masculine ideal established within R&B and hip hop culture. To this end, this study conducts a textual analysis of the representations of gender in the work of Frank Ocean and The Weeknd, artists considered representative for alternative R&B. The analysis reveals that Ocean’s work features successful nonnormative masculine identities, whereas The Weeknd refrains to representing postmodern exaggerations of the hegemonic male. Despite divergent representational strategies, both artists do engage in questioning what it means to be a man in R&B and hip hop culture and thereby at least attempt to challenge the supremacy of hegemonic masculinity. © The Author(s) 2014.","2-s2.0-84930511616","Belgium"

Analyses by parents' and children's gender suggest that there are gender differences in intergenerational support because of gender roles and divisions in families. The analysis shows that older mothers receive more returns, which reciprocates their support, while older fathers benefit more from the out-migration of adult children. Although sons take more responsibility for family support, daughters reciprocate support from their elderly parents more.

However, there is scarce literature on how women with FGM/C respond to treatment interventions. Objective: In this study, we aimed to assess changes in depression symptomatology, sexual function, and distress following clitoral reconstructive surgery combined with a psychoeducational intervention. Methods: The reconstructive surgery consisted of recovering the remaining clitoris and placing it externally and as close to the vagina as possible. FGM/C patients (n = 27) received psychological support and sexual counseling upon undergoing the surgical intervention and were further assessed at 6-month follow-up. Moreover, they completed the Beck Depression Inventory and the Female Sexual Distress Scale Revised at these two time points. Patients’ sexual dysfunction was assessed according to DSM-5 criteria. Results: Statistically significant clinical changes after FGM/C were reported. Overall, patients presented reduced depression and sexual distress levels, and decreased female sexual interest/arousal disorder prevalence. Results also revealed that sexual distress improvements were more significant in Type I FGM/C patients. Conclusions: Significant improvements in sexual distress, psychopathology, and sexual function were observed in our sample following reconstructive surgery, suggesting that combined interventions are effective for treatment. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85061054037","Spain"

Evidence collected from a sequence of in-depth qualitative studies in the Global South highlights the diverse ways that the giving of respect and the struggle to be respected shapes women’s lives. We show that moral education has a role to play in foregrounding female voices in order to: better understand the poverty-gender-education nexus; recognise the contribution of women and mothers as moral educators; acknowledge girls’ struggles to gain self-respect, peer respect and mitigate disrespect; and, ensure sexual respect despite aggressive masculinities.

"639",2009,"Journal of African American Studies","Marriage among African Americans: What does the research reveal?","The research reveals that African Americans are the least likely to marry, when they marry, they do so later and spend less time married than White Americans, and they are the least likely to stay married. Factors contributing to the marriage status of African Americans include structural, cultural, individual and interactive factors. Structural factors include the disparity in sex ratios between African American males and females and employment instability among African American males. Cultural factors include changing cultural trends such as marriage not being a perquisite for sex, the independence of women, the shift from familism to individualism, cohabitation as an increasing option, and the promotion of the values of materialism and patriarchy through popular culture. Individual factors stem from an internalization of cultural values that affects people's perceptions of marriage and their expectations of potential mates, their willingness to commit to a relationship that can lead to marriage, and, once they marry, their willingness to sustain the marriage through the challenges it will face. Added to this is the fact that, until recent federal funding in 2006, there was little or no education to help couples sustain relationships to marriage or sustain the marriage after they are married. In addition, all members of US society are expected to conform to the dominant group's idea of the monogamous, nuclear family. This forces those who opt for other life styles e.g., gay and lesbian, polygynous, etc., to stay in cohabitating relationships. All of these factors contributes to African Americans being less likely to marry and more likely to divorce. © 2008 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-58649117737","United States"

Despite an increase in initiatives that encourage women to enter STEM-related fields,some women continue to feel marginalized or believe that the environment is outright hostile to them. Taken together,these trends indicate a set of cultural expectations that are detrimental to the retention of women in STEM-related fields. The purpose of this study was to understand how some females resist cultural expectations and remain in engineering and to examine how undergraduate women negotiate cultural expectations while pursuing engineering degrees. Using case study research methods,the study investigated the experiences,attitudes and strategies of 21 undergraduate women,from different graduating classes,who remained and succeeded in an undergraduate civil and/or environmental engineering program. The results indicated that these aspiring women engineers were situated in a supportive academic program and were able to thrive and succeed,yet challenges and barriers outside the academic setting continue to persist. A sense of belonging to a group,strong role models,and self-confidence enabled these women to persist in their civil and environmental engineering programs. These women also struggled with gender identity and stereotype threat as they continued through engineering programs. The words of these women help explicate and illuminate the ways in which women negotiate cultural expectations by remaining in the civil and/or environmental programs.

Drawing on official statistics and an innovative, qualitatively driven, mixed method sociological autopsy of individual suicides, the authors of this paper argue that the vulnerability of 'young' men to suicide is often exaggerated and that insufficient attention is paid to the diverse social circumstances of suicidal men and women across the life course. Detailed analysis of 100 case files selected from a single coroner's office in the UK reveals that patterns of suicide can be seen to map on to conventional features of a socially structured life course, with young people in crisis, mid-life gendered patterns of work and family and older people in decline. Particular attention is drawn to suicide among those in mid-life and to the role of the social bond, especially in the form of attachment. Relationship breakdown is considered in some detail because it is central to understanding the demography of suicide and the significance of social bonds. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Content analysis was used to determine the extent of CSR reporting. A reporting level index consisting of 51 items was developed based on six themes: General, Community, Environment, Human Resources, Marketplace, and Other. An ordinary least square regression was employed to determine the association between both gender diversity and educational background, and CSR reporting. The results reveal that the proportion of female directors and directors’ educational background are not associated with CSR reporting levels. The findings are consistent with the critical mass theory which argues that a mass of three or more women can cause a fundamental change in boardroom dynamics. As representation of women on corporate boards in Malaysia is very limited at this moment, regulators and policymakers should be more stringent in monitoring board diversity. On the whole, this study proposes that a well-managed diversity contributes to an effective board, thus serving to safeguard all stakeholders’ interests.

Eventually a sample of this subset (N = 285) also participated in individual in-depth interviews. Results illustrate differences between mothers in their 30s and 40s in the decision on managing dual pressures of childcare and limited income. Accordingly, younger mothers were fully concerned with childcare, as their children were younger. As such, they put the idea of employment aside even though they faced financial hardship. In contrast, the older mothers suffered more from work-family conflict, as they more likely engaged in employment. Easing younger mothers' childcare and older mothers' work-family interplay is therefore a reasonable concern for public support for the mothers.","2-s2.0-84875916036","Hong Kong"

Relying primarily on publications such as Der Kreis, Die Insel/Der Weg, Amigo, and Du & Ich, this paper argues that as white West German homosexual men made a case for the end of legal discrimination and for social acceptance, they often constructed their arguments and identity as a persecuted minority in relation to the struggles and imagined experiences of colonized men and racial minorities. At the same time, however, many homosexual men still maintained a set of assumptions about racial difference that exoticized and essentialized men of color, assumptions that are particularly apparent in the erotic representations (both visual and literary) of men of color that appeared in these magazines. I further argue that, although historians of homosexuality in West Germany have traditionally viewed 1969 as a break, due to the radical changes in gay life that followed the 1969 reform of the anti-sodomy statute, the tensions between racial liberalism and exoticization continued well into the 1970s and in a remarkably similar published format. The contradictions within these magazines add to the growing literature on both homosexuality and race in postwar West Germany. Through the close examination of a medium that was crucial to the formation of homosexual communities and the development reformist politics, we can more fully understand the complexities and tensions on which minority politics were built in the wake of fascism. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84960398565","United States"

The article traces and exposes how religion has been deployed by international actors, donors, states, feminists, development practitioners, and human rights activists in engaging with gender issues. It analyses both the underlying motives for promoting a 'religionised' form of engagement with gender issues by these actors and how it is reflected in their policy and practice. It argues that various forms of instrumentalisation of religion, gender and human rights need to be examined against the backdrop of volatile political context, the rise of identity politics and increased economic inequality and deprivation. In particular, the article questions what an instrumentalised approach to religion means for negotiating the terms of engagement for addressing women's rights as well as how it impacts their day to day realities. © 2011 The Author.

Data on which this article is based were collected in 61 in-depth interviews with menopausal women in a midwest state in 2001. Findings suggest that biomedical definitions of menopause are often reaffirmed within interactions between intimate partners. Thus, women reported negative familial interactions about menopause, as they were encouraged to define symptoms as problematic and seek medical treatment. Alternatively, some interviewees reported positive interactions about menopause, as a few partners helped them soothe symptoms and follow health regimens. Women interpreted these latter interactions as support or care, rather than surveillance or monitoring. The author concludes that familial interactions bolster dominant constructions of both menopause and family because, as menopause is discussed between intimate partners, definitions of gendered familial roles and responsibilities are cemented. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.

"654",2010,"Gender, Place and Culture","A changing sense of Somaliness: Somali women in London and Toronto","This article considers how direct and indirect transnational linkages influence Somali refugee women settling in London, England and Toronto, Canada, and lead to shifts in identity in resettlement contexts. Drawing on interviews with Somali refugee women and discussions with resettlement staff, this article shows that under influences of distant and local linkages with other Somalis and through the cultural and social influences of the receiving society, Somali women develop a changing sense of their own Somaliness. The article argues that indicators of belonging, such as dress, religion and language, come to hold new and increased value within the new context, and familiar facets of national, cultural and religious identity shift in significance in response to competing influences and are used as intentional signifiers of identity. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-77954415307","United Kingdom"

In addition, it has been associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Undergraduate students (N = 135) completed the Indecisiveness Scale (Frost & Shows, 1993) and three other measures. It was found that women are more indecisive than men. Furthermore, indecisiveness correlated positively with several obsessive-compulsive complaints (e.g., checking and rumination), but negatively with life satisfaction. Finally, indecisiveness was associated with the number of do-not-know answers on a scale containing political statements that had to be evaluated by participants. The latter finding suggests that indecisive individuals not only need more time to reach a decision, but that they also actually fail to reach decisions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"656",2016,"Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology","Dreams of Canadian Students: Norms, Gender Differences, and Comparison With American Norms","A total of 600 dream reports were collected from 300 Canadian university students, 150 female and 150 male, and their content analyzed with the Hall and Van de Castle (1966) system of categories. The main dream content categories were characters, aggressive and friendly interactions, positive and negative emotions, and dream outcomes. The main purpose of the analysis was to provide normative data for a large sample of young Canadians to determine (a) whether negative elements prevail over positive ones, as assumed by the threat simulation theory and (b) whether dream gender differences are consistent with differences in waking life, in accordance with the continuity hypothesis. Overall, findings support both theories. The final objective was to compare the Canadian data, relative to gender differences, with normative data established in 1966 with the original American sample. Findings for males and females and gender differences remain consistent with the American normative data for most categories despite a 50 years interval. Similarities in Canadian and American dream content reflect similarities between the respective cultures. They also attest to fundamental structural dimensions of dream content that transcend cultures. Other types of content analysis relative to themes, for instance, might be appropriate to highlight cultural differences. © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-84978698901","Canada"

This article examines the evolution of this landmark study and explores the well-being of LGBTQ adults aged 80 years and older (n = 200), the most underrepresented group in the field. Based on the Iridescent Life Course, we examined the diverse, intersectional nature of LGBTQ older adults’ lives, finding high levels of education and poverty. Microaggressions were negatively associated with quality-of-life and positively associated with poor physical and mental health; the inverse relationship was found with mastery. When the oldest encountered risks, it resulted in greater vulnerability. This longitudinal study is assessing trajectories in aging over time using qualitative, quantitative, and biological data and testing evidence-based culturally responsive interventions for LGBTQ older adults.

"658",2008,"Asian Journal of Women's Studies","A feminist choice between the two types of Buddhist compassion","The aim of this paper is to distinguish early Buddhist compassion from Mahayana Buddhist compassion, and to suggest that the former can be a feminist choice. Early Buddhist compassion takes a principle of equal-regarding and does not encourage self-sacrifice. It rejects self-sacrificial altruism as well as other-sacrificial egoism. Contrarily, Mahayana Buddhist compassion encourages one to sacrifice oneself without seeking one's own happiness and to take the suffering of all sentient beings. Early Buddhist equal-regarding compassion can be a feminist choice because it rejects self-sacrifice. When equal-regarding compassion is applied to an ethic of care, the feminist concern - care can force women to sacrifice themselves and deepen their submission and subordination - is expected to be resolved to some degree.","2-s2.0-42649126338","O.-S."

We explore some of the reasons for the relationship between gender diversity and cash holdings. Specifically, this paper focuses on the choices involving the stock of cash held by firms in which women have executive roles and can consequently exert a crucial influence on the firms themselves. We estimate our proposed empirical models using a dataset of 12,466 observations from 18 European countries. We find a positive relationship between the presence of women with executive roles in the firm and cash holdings. Women tend to make more conservative choices probably because they are more risk averse than men are. This propensity has a relevant impact on the financial choices of firms when women play a leading role. Notably, the study demonstrates that the institutional environment and industry differences moderate our baseline relationship. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85061566287","Italy"

"662",2017,"Journal of Management Inquiry","Gender Equality: A View From India","The author interviewed nine high-ranking businesswomen in India. The interviews gave him a different perspective on the question of gender equality. The argument for women’s participation is neither about the democratic principle of equal opportunity – in numerical terms, nor is it about making use of the full managerial talent available in the country/world. The present day solutions are based on these two woefully inadequate premises. When women do not participate at the highest levels it means our business world is losing an entire feminine perspective to imagination, ideation, planning, team work, empathy and strategic decision-making. However, today’s business-world and the various social systems – education, healthcare, legal and political systems - are not only male-dominated but are also male-designed. For a woman to compete and succeed, she may have at times to become more male than the males. Therefore, the words ‘gender equality’ and ‘gender neutrality’ could be misleading. Instead, women need ‘respect’ i.e. accepting them the way they are. Actually what we need to do is to create a world (economic, business, social and political) that utilizes the best of both masculine and feminine qualities, not just create ‘opportunities’ for women to excel in a man’s world. We need a complete overhaul of the social systems and we need to start at the basics – home and school. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","2-s2.0-85002410231","India"

"664",2015,"Social Compass","‘Men of iron will’: Idealized gender in Christian heavy metal","The borders between sacred and secular music are often believed to be fixed and impenetrable. However, when a secular musical genre is reworked for consumption by religious audiences, a space is created where the sacred meets the secular, and this can be used to examine the variety of ways in which cultural norms, values, and ideologies fluctuate and converge between the religious and temporal spheres. In this article, the author looks at the overlapping of Christian and secular heavy metal music, focusing on the ways gender is described, celebrated, and normalized in the lyrics of Christian metal. After analyzing the lyrics of 351 Christian heavy metal songs, she conducts an in-depth analysis of three sets of lyrics. Despite the obvious antithesis between the worlds of heavy metal music and evangelical Christianity, her analysis highlights one avenue where the sacred and secular merge. The display, production, and management of gender can be viewed as a common trope that links Christian metal to secular metal and can function as a means of creating a space for the alignment of religious beliefs within the larger cultural expectations of gender. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","2-s2.0-84948987372","United States"
"665",2015,"Addictive Behaviors","Gender differences in planning ability and hepatitis C virus among people who inject drugs","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is primarily spread through risky injection practices, including sharing needles, cookers, cottons, rinse water, and the practice of backloading. An important aspect of harm reduction for people who inject drugs (PWID) is to identify factors that contribute to safer injection. Planning ability may influence risky injection practices and gender differences in factors that drive injection practices indicate a need to examine associations between planning and injection behaviors in men versus women. Data from the NEURO-HIV Epidemiologic Study was restricted to those who had ever injected in their lifetime (n= 456). Impaired planning ability was assessed with the Tower of London and defined as a standardized total excess move score below the 10th percentile. We used logistic regression to estimate the gender-specific adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between impaired planning, each injection practice, and biologically-confirmed HCV. Impaired planning ability was associated with sharing needles (AOR = 2.93, 95% CI: 1.33, 6.47), cookers (AOR = 3.13, 95% CI: 1.22, 8.02), cottons (AOR = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.23, 6.78), rinse water (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.15, 5.14), and backloading (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.26, 5.70) and HCV (AOR = 3.42, 95% CI: 1.03, 11.38) among men. Planning ability was not significantly associated with the injection behaviors or HCV among women, suggesting that other factors likely contribute to risky injection practices. Interventions to promote harm reduction among PWID should ascertain and strengthen planning ability. Women may have additional barriers to practicing safe injection beyond impaired planning abilities, which should also be addressed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-84926486448","United States"
"666",2016,"Psychology of Women Quarterly","Minority Stress, Body Shame, and Binge Eating Among Lesbian Women: Social Anxiety as a Linking Mechanism","Minority stress, which includes discrimination as well as internalized negative attitudes, is an important factor associated with maladaptive health behaviors such as binge eating among sexual minority individuals. In addition, body shame and social anxiety are robust predictors of binge eating. We examined social anxiety and body shame as sequential mediators of the association between minority stress and binge eating among young adult lesbian women. We hypothesized that social anxiety would be a key factor linking minority stress to body shame and binge eating. Self-identified lesbian women (N = 496) completed online measures of minority stress, social anxiety, body shame, and binge eating. Structural equation modeling supported the hypothesized model. Discrimination and proximal sexual minority stress were associated with increased social anxiety. In turn, social anxiety was associated with more body shame, and body shame was related to binge eating. Results suggest the oppressive social environments created by the experience of minority stress may have adverse consequences for lesbian women’s body satisfaction and eating behaviors. Interventions that bolster coping with sexual minority stress and focus on reducing social anxiety, in addition to targeting eating behavior directly, may be particularly useful for lesbian women with eating disorders or binge eating.

"669",2016,"Drugs and Alcohol Today","Gender, recovery and contemporary UK drug policy","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a gendered reading of the 2010 UK drug strategy and draw out the implications of the new recovery paradigm for female drug users. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the concept of recovery at a theoretical level, uncovering the taken-for-granted assumptions in the three overarching principles: freedom from dependence; well-being; and citizenship. It also analyses the available quantitative and qualitative evidence on women’s access to recovery capital to explore the role gender might play in the journey to recovery. Findings – Strategic thinking around recovery in the UK is largely silent on gender. However, close scrutiny of the available, albeit limited, evidence base on female drug users and feminist scholarship on the principles of well-being and citizenship suggests the need to understand recovery against a backdrop of the social and normative context of women’s lives. Originality/value – Recent analyses of contemporary UK drug policy have focused on the conflation of recovery with abstinence and the displacement of the harm reduction agenda. They have failed to draw out the implications for particular groups of drug users such as women. The pursuit of recovery-based drug policy is not peculiar to the UK so the paper offers a case study of its gendered application in a particular national context. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-84958690869","United Kingdom"

I offer four illustrations of this relatively recent departure from conventional birth imagery and discuss (1) the 2006 sculpture of Britney Spears birthing on a bearskin rug, (2) the crowning scene in the 2007 movie Knocked Up, (3) a 2012 birth scene depicted in the HBO show Game of Thrones, and (4) a birth montage from an episode of the Netflix show Sense8, to suggest that representations of birth no longer solely depict asexual bodies. I consider the consequences that these sexualized representations of the birthing body might have for women’s embodied experience of birth and evaluate this sexy birth imagery in light of a cultural shift towards an increasingly (hetero)sexualized femininity. In particular, I am interested to explore how normative (hetero)sexualized femininity may align with the growing medical management of childbirth and the uptick in surgical delivery. I investigate whether graphic depictions of birth leave us with increased sexual objectification or the possibility for a new sexual subjecthood. I close by offering a queer reading of the birth depictions in the Netflix drama Sense8 and consider how its non-normative depictions of women’s laboring bodies may unsettle the powerful norms that constitute (hetero)sexualized femininity and refigure women’s experiences of childbirth. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","2-s2.0-85039757284","United States"

Much of this research tends to focus on two perspectives-exposure reduction and the backlash/retaliation hypotheses-when explaining the link between intimate partner homicide and domestic violence resources. Support has been found for both approaches even though they offer contradictory predictions. This frustrating finding is further complicated by methodological issues, such as the inability to address the rare nature of these events, offer a wide range of domestic violence services and resources and control for structural characteristics of urban areas where violence is found. This issue is addressed by offering a systematic examination of male- and female-victim intimate partner homicide in 2000. The current study investigates both exposure reduction and backlash arguments, in addition to economic deprivation and a number of structural factors relevant to homicide rates. Results suggest that while these perspectives are relevant to intimate partner homicides, there are statistically significant differences across the gender-specific models once the corrected statistical test for coefficient equality is estimated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-77957019132","United States"
"673",2017,"Sex Roles","What is a True Gamer? The Male Gamer Stereotype and the Marginalization of Women in Video Game Culture","Women and men play video games in approximately equal numbers. Despite this similarity, video gaming is still strongly associated with men. A common justification for this stereotype is that, although women might play games, they should not be considered “true” or “hard-core” gamers because they play more casually and less skillfully compared to their male counterparts. In this contribution, we review the existing literature on gender and gaming to investigate the male gamer stereotype in terms of its accuracy, persistence, effects, and future perspective. We conclude that the stereotype varies in accuracy depending on the definition of “gamer.” We further argue that the persistence of this stereotype can be explained by the fact that almost all professional and highly visible figures in gaming culture are male. On the other hand, female players who achieve a moderate level of competence are rendered invisible or are actively marginalized. We argue that the effects of the male gamer stereotype can be harmful to women, precluding them from the positive outcomes of video game play such as enhanced access to fields of science, technology, and engineering. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84986269557","Australia"

We find that hemoglobin level, a marker for anemia, is lower for respondents with no schooling (0.7 g/dL less in the adjusted model) compared to those with some formal education and is also lower for females than for males (2.0 g/dL less in the adjusted model). In addition, we find that about one third of respondents in our sample aged 45 or older have high C-reaction protein (CRP) levels (>3 mg/L), an indicator of inflammation and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We find no evidence of educational or gender differences in CRP, but there are significant state-level disparities, with Kerala residents exhibiting the lowest CRP levels (a mean of 1.96 mg/L compared to 3.28 mg/L in Rajasthan, the state with the highest CRP). We use the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition approach to explain group-level differences, and find that state-level disparities in CRP are mainly due to heterogeneity in the association of the observed characteristics of respondents with CRP, rather than differences in the distribution of endowments across the sampled state populations. © 2015 The Authors.

From the late 1940s onwards, Forest's fiction articulates what Adrienne Rich theorizes in her classic work of lesbian ethics, """"Women and Honor: Some Notes on Lying"""" (1975): the idea of same-sex bonds as the locus and standard of the ethical. Through the characters of the Marlow family (six sisters, two brothers) and their friends and enemies, Forest explores questions of honesty and self-deception, fidelity (both religious and personal) and betrayal, integrity and duality, performance and the boundaries of the self. Forest's exploration of these questions is persistently inflected by a resistance to heterosexuality and by a privileging of same-sex bonds, whether female or male.

Exploring the impact of the crime congruency effect on jurors' perceptions of auditor negligence","This study investigates the liability risk associated with auditors' personal and financial conflicts of interest, and the potential for differences in liability exposure based on the gender of the auditor. A survey-based experiment was performed with 160 jury-eligible participants who reviewed a scenario in which an auditor, the defendant, failed to detect and report fraudulent behavior on the part of a client. The plaintiffs in this case are investors in the company who sustained financial losses due to the fraud, asserting that the audit firm should be liable for damages. A 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment examined how the auditor's gender (male/female) and the motivations of the alleged conflict of interest (personal vs. financial) influence jury-eligible individuals' perceptions of the defendant's independence and liability for negligence and fraud. Results indicate that female auditors are perceived as less independent and more liable for a personal conflict of interest, compared to male auditors. Male auditors are perceived as less independent and more liable for a financial conflict of interest, compared to female auditors. Auditors, regardless of gender, were perceived as less independent and more liable for a personal conflict of interest compared to a financial conflict of interest. The outcome of this study could be utilized to educate audit firms on the potential risks of liability that could emerge in unanticipated areas, and to assist with audit planning and legal decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85028345766","United States"

This gives a total prison population of around 800 000 people. These people are detained in penal facilities built during the Soviet era, the majority of which are in peripheral locations. Because the peripheries have been selected as 'sites of punishment, Russia's distinctive 'geography of penality' makes the maintenance of social contacts of prisoners difficult and undermines attempts to reduce the rates of recidivism in Russia. Women are drawn into the penal complex by virtue of their relationships with the majority male prisoner population, a process which transforms them into 'quasi-prisoners' and reproduces gender stereotypes. © 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.","2-s2.0-34047241618","United Kingdom"

Our main finding is an overall lack of significant gender differences in behavior. In the treatments with penalties for shirking, female employers offer higher rent compared to men and in those treatments this generosity affects female earnings adversely. We find that while workers do reciprocate more generous contract offers by shirking less, there are no pronounced gender differences in shirking. We find that not using a penalty when the option is available leads to significantly higher levels of shirking. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","2-s2.0-84947807347","New Zealand"

In this paper, we take a holistic approach to violence, extending the definition from that commonly in use to encompass domestic violence and sexual violence. We operationalize that definition by using data from the latest sweep of the Crime Survey for England and Wales. By so doing, we identify that violence is currently under-measured and ubiquitous; that it is gendered, and that other forms of violence (family violence, acquaintance violence against women) are equally of concern.

However, little is known about how to address the health consequences of GBV against women in high-prevalence settings where GBV is widely accepted as normal. Objective: This study examines the potential for narrative storytelling to support women's mental health and alleviate the suffering caused by GBV in high-prevalence settings. It adopts a symbolic interactionist perspective to explore the perceptions and lived experiences of women living in safe houses for GBV in Afghanistan. Method: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with women (n = 20) in two Afghanistan safe houses between March and May 2017. The data were analysed both inductively and deductively using thematic network analysis. Results: The findings reveal the stigmatising and traumatic experiences many women have had when telling their stories of GBV in this context. In contrast, storytelling under supportive conditions was perceived to be a highly valuable experience that could help formulate positive social identities and challenge broader social structures. The supportive conditions that contributed to a positive storytelling experience included the presence of a sympathetic non-judgemental listener and a supportive social environment. Conclusions: These findings offer an alternative to biomedical models of mental health support for women experiencing GBV in high-prevalence settings. They raise the importance of tackling broader social changes that challenge patriarchal social structures, and highlight the potential role that narrative storytelling approaches can play in high-prevalence settings like Afghanistan. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85052204241","United Kingdom"

The possibility to purchase fertility treatments in a similar way to other products and services has led not only to a clearly defined market place and customer, but has also contributed to scholarly work on critical studies of kinship. To date, however, there has been little research enquiring into how new media technologies relied upon by parents for finding fertility information may contribute to shaping and circulating ideas of kinship. Within the transnational fertility marketplace, Denmark has become a hub for would-be parents due to liberal legislation, cheaper prices and shorter waiting times. As the first contact point for potential fertility travellers, the websites of Danish fertility clinics and sperm banks fulfil several roles, including marketing, disseminating information about scientific breakthroughs, and providing guidance on healthy lifestyle choices for potential parents. Using multimodal analysis of home pages, this paper examines how the websites of Danish fertility clinics and sperm banks contribute to shaping and circulating ideas about kinship. These websites attract and engage with customers by creating emotive representations of kinship that rely on the mother-child image. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85053886685","Sweden"

The post-pubertal association of female gender with emotional disorder is a robust finding. However, studies exploring the association of gender and emotional disorders before puberty are few and present diverging results. The aim of this study was to present gender-specific incidence rates of emotional disorders throughout childhood. Method. This is a population-based cohort study of 907 806 Danish 3- to 18-year-olds. The outcome was assignment of an emotional disorder diagnosis based on in-patient and out-patient data from The Danish Psychiatric Central Register. Outcome measures were incidence rates and cumulative incidences for unipolar depressive disorder (ICD-10: F32-F33), anxiety disorders (ICD-10: F40-F42), and emotional disorders with onset specific to childhood (ICD-10: F93). Results. Pre-pubertal incidence rates for depressive and anxiety disorders were higher for boys than girls. At age 12 years the pattern reversed. The cumulative incidence for any emotional disorder (F32-F33, F40-F42, F93) on the 11th birthday was 0.52% (95% CI 0.50-0.55) for boys and 0.31% (95% CI 0.29-0.33) for girls. On the 19th birthday cumulative incidence was 2.33% (95% CI 2.24-2.43) for boys and 3.77% (95% CI 3.64-3.90) for girls. The pre-pubertal male preponderance was also significant for depressive disorders (F32-F33, p = 0.00144) and anxiety disorders (F40-F42, F93, p < 0.00001) separately. Conclusions. Emotional disorders seem to display a male preponderance before the age of 12 years and a female preponderance thereafter. Studies exploring this gender-age interaction are needed. Still, the results question the general assumption that females throughout the lifespan are more at risk for emotional disorders than males.

The analytical methodology is the autobiographic experience, based on the Benjaminian storyteller, and the results are constituted by this experience under analysis within a narrative organized in three moments: (1) the discussions within a group of professors of these courses about the inclusion of such issues in the curriculum; (2) the construction of study plans; and (3) the experiences in the classroom. The narrated process shows that the issues on gender and sexualities, from a scientific perspective (gender and queer studies, and feminisms) are incipient on these courses, unknown to the students, and a challenge to the school.

The gap persists even when controlling for sources of heterogeneity, the selection of inventors into types of jobs and tasks, and potential parenthood, instrumented by exploiting a source of variation related to religious practices. The income gap is not associated with differences in the quality of the inventions that female and male inventors produce.

We find that a 1 % increase in entrepreneurial activity increases the number of informal investors by 1.7 %. However, the average invested amount declines by 0.8 %, leading to a net positive total increase of about 0.9 %. This result indicates that, to a considerable extent, demand for informal investment creates its own supply. As a result, the research finds that market forces help solve finance constraints for new ventures and hence lessen the need for public policy intervention.

This subordination of human rights to other, market-related, priorities parallels global governance priorities in general.

In doing so, it contributes to scholarship about these children but its focus is one that has been only partially explored. It begins by showing how children's welfare continues to be the ground on which both homophobic and pro-gay public discourse stakes territory. The article documents the emergence in Australia, since the early 2000s, of a new self-defined subject position, evident in a range of Internet sources. The article analyzes the ways in which the voices which speak from this position are both constituted by the pro-gay discourse and also speak back to it. Three themes are identified and analyzed: resistance to the binary opposition of the child at risk versus the prospering child, responses to heteronormativity and homophobia, and the “love makes a family” discourse. While the children of gay and lesbian parents are not immune to the public discourses that create them as objects of debate, attention to their self-consciously political voices reveals that they also resist the norms of the pro-gay position (and the homophobic position) and begin to create space for a more diverse picture of their lives. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84930753200","Australia"
"700",2007,"Development and Change","Feminism, gender, and women's peace activism","United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on 'Women, peace and security', passed in 2000, reflects a recent growth in women's peace activism. Women's resistance to violence is widely believed to be a mobilizing factor in both local and international peace movements. This provokes questions around essentialism and violence of concern to feminists: are men inherently territorial and aggressive, and women naturally nurturing and peaceable?Or is the behaviour of both conditioned by particular local configurations of social relations of power? This contribution reviews these questions in the light of the experiences of women's peace organizations. It concludes that essentializing women's roles as wives, mothers and nurses discourages their inclusion as active decision makers in political arenas, as well as overshadowing the needs of other disadvantaged groups. Rather than seeing war as the violation of women by men, we should recognize that men and women are each differently violated by war. © Institute of Social Studies 2007.","2-s2.0-33846846422","United Kingdom"

Parental Migration, Remittances, and Social Support","Abstract: China is undergoing a remarkably large scale of rural-to-urban migration. In many cases this migration is individual rather than familial due to a variety of constraints, causing widespread separate living arrangements. Guided by an inquiry about the impacts of parental migration on children’s physical and mental health in rural China, the present study asks the following question: what roles do remittances and social support play in left-behind children’s health outcomes? The findings highlight the disadvantaged situation experienced by children whose both parents are migrants and point to the promising countervailing functions of remittances and family support in protecting these children from mental health decline. However, friend support does not seem helpful in the absence of parent(s), and a larger number of good friends even increase the risk of getting sick. Interestingly, my analysis also reveals a possible nonmonetary effect of remittances level, which may reflect a family’s economic reliance on emigration and bring extra stress to the members remaining at home. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85006944303","United States"
"702",2018,"Research Policy","Unintended consequences on gender diversity of high-tech growth and labor market polarization","There has been considerable media coverage highlighting the lack of gender diversity in Silicon Valley, stressing the relatively low participation of women in the high-tech economy. Austin offers a unique case for testing whether similar gender issues characterized other high-tech regions because the city has historically benefited from the expansion of Silicon Valley's large high-tech firms since the 1980s. The gender-biased business practices identified in Silicon Valley firms may have been transferred to their branch plants in Austin. Our analysis shows women's losses in middle-skill occupation employment shares were concentrated in the low-tech industry and were partially offset by job share gains in high-skill occupations in the same sector between 1980 and 2015. Men's losses in middle-skill occupation job share were also mainly concentrated in the low-tech sector but were partially offset by employment share gains in high-skill occupations only in the high-tech industry during this period. Women made large gains in relative real median wages only in high-skill occupations in the high-tech industry while their relative real median wages in other skill occupations and in the low-tech industry stagnated around zero during this period. Men's gains in relative median wages were also concentrated only in the high-tech industry but were less than half of women's and were negative (between -10 and -21 percent) in other occupations in the high-tech industry and across all occupations in the low-tech industry. As noted in previous studies, the impact of job polarization is not well understood across sectors and gender. This study finds the high-tech industry in Austin has had unintended consequences in terms of job polarization across gender, providing relatively fewer job opportunities in high-skill occupations to women than men but offering much higher gains in relative real median wages to women than men. Males also found relatively more job opportunities in high-skill occupations in the high-tech industry than women but experienced only half of women's gains in relative median wages in this industry between 1980 and 2015. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","2-s2.0-85032982479","United States"

These pageants portray hyperbolic femininity as a meritocratic practice of gendered discipline and consumption that yields material rewards, conflating girl power with subscription to the current social fetishisation of girl power. Moreover, this representation of girlhood highlights the irrelevance of older generations, in a way that speaks to the post-feminist - and third wave - repudiation of second wave feminism. Specifically, I analyse the TLC reality television show Toddlers and Tiaras as a text that represents the mother-daughter dyad so as to make mothers obsolete and a hindrance to the potential of their dynamic and empowered daughters. This allows post-feminist girlhood to triumph as the most relevant and desirable model for young women, while scapegoating monstrous moms for the problematic, exploitative aspects of the show. When such mother-daughter relations are highlighted, diametrically opposed and negatively portrayed, they recall the symbolic logic of contemporary feminist movements and their rejection of the experiences and knowledge of older generations of feminists. I argue that destroying the rich historical legacy of feminism further distances post-feminist subjects from the potential of future political coalitions. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84929044059","United States"

He's a guy': A mixed-methods study of gender double-standards for alcohol use","Although drinking and drunkenness have traditionally been considered masculine behaviours, young women's alcohol consumption has increased in recent years. This mixed methods study was conducted to examine the extent to which young people endorse gender double-standards for alcohol use - i.e., less acceptance of drinking and drunkenness in women than men - and how these influence men's and women's alcohol consumption. A sample of 731 English university students completed an online survey of gender role attitudes, beliefs about the gendered nature of alcohol use and recent alcohol consumption. Sixteen participants were then purposively selected for individual interviews: eight women and men with the most egalitarian gender role beliefs, and eight women and men with the least egalitarian beliefs. The two sets of data revealed that although there were few sex differences in actual levels of drinking or drunkenness, gender double-standards for alcohol use persist: beer drinking, binge drinking and public drunkenness tended to be perceived as masculine, and even the most egalitarian respondents were more judgemental of women's drinking. Participants modified their drinking style so as to maintain a desired gender identity. Although gender double-standards could be a focus of interventions to encourage moderate drinking, such approaches could reinforce gender inequalities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84860276572","United Kingdom"

Rock n' roll and the new wave of youth-focused films seemed to critics to posit an alternative culture antagonistic to that of older generations. One cultural form sparked particular censorious intent: the horror comic book. Many critics of the 1940s and 1950s dwelt obsessively on the impact of horror comics on youthful readers. The culmination of this movement was the 1954 Senate Subcommittee Hearings on Juvenile Delinquency, which resulted in the implementation of a harsh new self-regulatory comics code and the end of the horror and crime genres. In this study, we argue that rather than (or perhaps as well as) promoting juvenile delinquency, horror comics served an important social function in that they presented a challenge to the dominant culture in cold war America. They corroborated the veteran experience; questioned faith in science and industry; recognised women as victims of war; and embodied, on occasion, many of the themes of the early Civil Rights movement. It was because of these countercultural impulses that the horror genre in comics was, ultimately, brought to an untimely end. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2-s2.0-85038007409","United Kingdom"

Further, SM/SN use has also not been well integrated with relevant paradigms from the psychology of men and masculinities paradigms. The present study contributes to both of these research need areas by testing the associations among SM/SN use, toxic masculinity, positive or negative SM/SN interactions, and depression among a sample of 402 men. Results of a structural equation modeling analysis indicated that SM/SN use and toxic masculinity were associated with depression.

In addition, it was found that the relationship between the sex of the participants and the type of infidelity that induced stress in them was affected by sociocultural variables, such as culture of honor, masculinity, and femininity. Some differences in the response patterns in the case of an infidelity, in both samples (Portuguese and Brazilian), are shown and discussed. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-85032662475","Brazil"

"712",2016,"Journal of Quantitative Criminology","Timing of Change in Criminal Offending Around Entrance into Parenthood: Gender and Cross-Country Comparisons for At-Risk Individuals","Objectives: This article examines the timing of change in criminal offending relative to entrance into parenthood, in light of four competing theoretical frameworks (social control, routine activities, strain and cognitive transformation). Moreover, it analyzes whether criminal developments over time are gender- or country-specific. Methods: Using samples of men and women at risk of offending in the Netherlands and Norway, this study investigates monthly changes in offending probabilities around the time of first birth (5 years before, 5 years after). The implemented smoothing splines technique allowed for a flexible exploration of changes in offending probabilities for both pre-childbirth and post-childbirth periods. Results: The results show that the probabilities to offend decline ahead of childbirth for all individuals analyzed. The post-childbirth period is characterized by increases in offending probabilities. However, in these overall trends, the exact timing and magnitude of change differs by gender and country of residence. Conclusions: The results offer partial support for the cognitive transformation hypothesis because offending rates decline before childbirth. The post-childbirth period converges with assumptions of the strain theory (for males in particular) because offending probabilities increase in this period. Additional analysis investigating changes in property offending shows that economic strain does not explain the upward trend of the overall offending after childbirth. © 2016, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-84955280453","Norway"

The patient note (PN) exercise is specifically used to assess a candidate's ability to summarize and synthesize the data collected in a simulated patient interview. In a 1-year period, over 7700 first time takers completed the CSA, resulting in over 77,000 physician-based performance ratings. An initial pilot study indicated that, based solely on handwriting, the raters were able to correctly classify the gender of the candidate approximately 70% of the time. This result, combined with the fact that the notes are holistically scored, suggests that rating bias is possible. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the gender of the candidate, the gender of the performing standardized patient, and the gender of the rater had any impact on scores. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that there was no significant interaction between candidate and rater gender. Female candidates significantly outperformed males, regardless of rater gender (p < 0.01, effect size=0.23). The results of this study suggest that, based on rater, SP, and candidate characteristics, the validity of the PN ratings is not compromised. © Springer 2005.","2-s2.0-21044437684","United States"

As India economically liberalizes, there is a generational gap that has developed. Young men begin to start bridging this gap by living their lives through various negotiations and performances of appropriate masculinities in the contexts that surround them. Social developments in India mean that processes of consumption, urbanization and new practices of romantic and sexual expression have to be managed alongside older gendered expectations and responsibilities on young men. Through an ethnographic approach, this paper explores the social and cultural realities of young Indian men to understand how they are caught in-between and creatively manage their lives and relationships. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85031911788","United Kingdom"

This study investigated the predictive validity of one such dynamic tool - the Dynamic Risk Assessment for Offender Re-entry (DRAOR) - with a sample of female and male parolees. Unexpectedly, the DRAOR subscales predicted recidivism for women, but not for men, and the acute risk subscale independently contributed to recidivism prediction. Furthermore, the DRAOR incrementally predicted women’s recidivism above static risk. These results support the use of the DRAOR with women offenders, and more generally, a ‘gender-neutral’ approach to risk assessment tools for women. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","2-s2.0-84955318396","New Zealand"

However, the literature provides conflicting evidence and shows that women’s empowerment may not, or may only be partially achieved through microcredit, especially in Muslim societies. This study seeks to scrutinize the effect of Amanah Ikhtiar Malaysia (AIM), a microcredit institution, on Malay Muslim women in an urban area. A quasi-experimental method was used to conduct a cross sectional survey of 500 old and new clients. Informal semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 current clients who had received microcredit two years earlier. The findings show that AIM microcredit empowered the women and enhanced gender equality. It enabled women to access financial capital, form their micro- and small-businesses and obtain an income which helped them to contribute to household expenditure. Even though the effect of microcredit was partial, it provided them bargaining power for decision-making and controlling of resources and enhanced their self-esteem in their households and communities. © 2016 Asian Center for Women's Studies, Ewha Womans University.","2-s2.0-84982972433","Malaysia"

"722",2009,"Gender, Place and Culture","Have sex will travel: Romantic 'sex tourism' and women negotiating modernity in the Sinai","Since the 1970s, studies on western women's ethnosexual tourist-local relationships have tended to focus on the beaches of the Caribbean and have come to one of two main conclusions - either they are no different from the overtly exploitative relationships of heterosexual male sex tourists or they are different because they involve a softer, caring element of romance. This article proposes that both positions have led to constrictive, circular research that highlights the racialised and economically disparate nature of these exchanges but mostly ignores the importance of imaginative and emotional geographies caught up in such relationships. Based on fieldwork interviews with men and women in the resorts of the South Sinai, Egypt, I argue that these encounters can be seen as examples of a modern subjectivity that are defined by and take place within imagined (fixed) constructions of landscapes, native third world masculinity (in this case Arab/Bedouin), femininity (white, heterosexual, western), freedom and love (spiritual and physical): All presented in some form of opposition to a particularist idea of modernity and viewed through a filter of selective (and spatially circumscribed) histories. By adding a geographical dimension, this article aims to open up the current debate on female sex tourism to a wider range of issues and reveal more of the conflicts, tensions and imaginations that make up these encounters.","2-s2.0-62349139841","United Kingdom"

In their accounts, fertility travelers employ a narrative in which oöcytes become necessary spare parts, yet also, exotic substances with temperament and racialized nationality as well as collective bodies - shaped by the recipient woman's body, intent, and desire. In this manner, kinship is created through shared blood and space, desire and intent while differences between recipients and donors are minimized.

It argues that Disney's adaptations of canonized literary fairy tales do not rest only on the perpetuation and further exacerbation of hierarchically structured gendered binarisms that abound in the original literary texts. It argues that these adaptations also rest on the introduction of a highly racialized discourse not found in the primary literary texts, which leads to a specific transmutation of literary fairy tales under consideration. The article takes as its basic theoretical premise A Theory of Adaptation by Linda Hutcheon and argues that rather than viewing adaptations as failed or incomplete attempts at translating literary fairy tales into an animated medium, these adaptations should be looked upon as transcodifications and transmutations of the original texts that acquire a life of their own. As such they come to act as substitutes for the original texts, which in turn, due to the consistent marketing policies pursued by Disney, come to be side-tracked or completely replaced by their Disneyfied versions. The article argues that Disney's adaptations of literary originals partake in the rehabilitation of old colonial tropes such as Black legend, which they take to new heights through the inclusion of the liberal discourse of multiculturalism and the usurpation of a seemingly pro-feminist discourse. The article incorporates Balibar's and Brown's theories on the resurgence of neo-racist discourse. In doing so, it traces different instances of neo-racist discourse found in Disney's animated films and focuses on the way recent restructurations of racist discourse are embedded in Disney's latest productions under the common denominator of multicultural pluralism. The article argues that the way in which the discourse of race is re-activated and once again justified on the home turf of Western democracies is directly related to a system of management and control of those constituted as external racialised others inhabiting geopolitical locations of significance to neo-colonial hegemons. Pocahontas and Aladdin constitute such a link. Disney's animated adaptations consistently construct native women as victims in need of rescue from their patriarchal cultures, while at the same time they strategically elide and obscure patriarchal histories and asymmetrical power relations affecting women in western societies. This is even more ironic considering that Disney's classic animations targeted at children and adults alike (such as Cinderella, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) have played a direct role in upholding and re-naturalizing the patriarchal premises of Western societies.","2-s2.0-84938534972","Slovenia"

Specifically, how gender diversity among full-time and part-time employees is associated with discretionary accruals in Korea is examined. Design/methodology/approach: The author analyzes the association between women ratio among full-time (part-time) employees and discretionary accruals by using 3,687 firm-years of Korean listed companies from 2010 to 2012. The regression model used in Barua et al. (2010) is adopted. The dependent variables, the absolute value of discretionary accruals, are proxied by the Modified Jones Model of Dechow et al. (1995) and the Performance Matched Model of Kothari et al. (2005). Findings: First, a higher ratio of women among full-time workers is related to lower discretionary accruals, whereas that of part-time female employees is not related to discretionary accruals. Second, the effect of gender diversity in employees varies depending on the possibility of earnings management. Third, the results are robust with sample firm-years without female executives, thereby suggesting that the results are not driven by the existence of female executives, and robust to accounting standards and firm-year clustering. Originality/value: This paper expands the understanding about the determination of discretionary accruals by demonstrating the impact of full-time female employees on earnings quality. Previous studies demonstrated that female workers are more ethical in the workplace, and the quality of accounting information disclosed by firms with female CFOs or directors, i.e. high ranking officers, is higher. It is observed that accounting information quality is higher when firms simply have more female workers, regardless of their relative position in the firm. This complements the results of previous studies and indicates gender diversity among employees is a sign of accounting information quality. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-85053267965","South Korea"

Women spend more time on housework and take on a higher amount of routine domestic work (e.g., cooking and cleaning) and care work (e.g., childcare). Men share a higher proportion of nonroutine domestic work (e.g., home repairs). Routine housework is negatively associated with one’s relative contribution to family income and working time. For both men and women living in rural areas, however, relative income forms a curvilinear relationship with routine housework and total housework time. Relative income and working time, however, are poor predictors in the gender division of nonroutine housework. Furthermore, they have more complex patterns of association with care work.

"734",2013,"Sex Roles","Restriction and Renewal, Pollution and Power, Constraint and Community: The Paradoxes of Religious Women's Experiences of Menstruation","Across cultures and historical time, menstruation has tended to be perceived as mysterious, dangerous and potentially contaminating. Most world religions place prohibitions on and prescribe codified purity rituals for menstruating women. We surveyed 340 religious and non-religious women from the Rocky Mountain West region of the United States regarding their attitudes and experiences of menstruation. We found that prescriptive religious women rated their periods as more bothersome, embarrassing, shameful, and endorsed more prohibitions, prescriptions and seclusion during menses compared to non-religious women. However, perhaps because their religions openly acknowledge menstruation, and their practice of rituals spotlights menstruation as a special time, religious women also identified a positive aspect of their menstrual cycles not shared by their non-religious counterparts. This was a heightened sense of community with other women. Further, women in committed relationships had more positive experiences of menstruation than single women, and this was especially true for women in prescriptive religions, despite a greater onus placed on them to observe menstrual rituals. This study complicates our understanding of how the practice of codified religious prohibitions and prescriptions around menstruation impacts women's experience. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-84872669940","United States"

Methodology - The data was gathered as part of a major fieldwork project that included in-depth interviews and participant observation. Findings - The research reveals a kind of transnational motherhood, which is invisible in the academic field. The strategy for work-family balance of the Chinese in Spain situates the mothers primarily in their productive dimension. Management of the work-family balance (the productive and reproductive work) depends on the phase of the family business path. Chinese families enact two different strategies for balancing work-family life: """"transnationalized"""" reproduction and """"externalized"""" reproduction. In both strategies, Chinese women do not engage in intensive motherhood, but at the same time they do remain highly involved in the home. The analysis of the productive-reproductive continuum shows the complexity of the gender relationships within the Chinese family enterprise. Theoretical implications - Fieldwork data discloses a dynamic social relationship and suggest a revision of the theoretical assumptions used to explain the links among gender, work, and family in transnational space. Practical implications - As global immigration continues to grow, adjustments and flexibility will be required of all parties. Immigrant families will have to contend with family reunification policies that vary from nation to nation. Because immigrant family dynamics can be culture-specific, receiving nations will require flexible policies in housing, education, and other sectors.

It relies on International Monetary Fund (IMF) fiscal projections and IMF country reports to gauge how social assistance and other public spending decisions have evolved since the start of the global economic crisis. The study finds that most developing countries boosted total expenditures during the first phase of the crisis (2008-09); but beginning in 2010, budget contraction became widespread, with ninety-one governments cutting overall spending in 2012. Moreover, the data suggest that nearly one-quarter of developing countries underwent excessive fiscal contraction, defined as cutting expenditures below pre-crisis levels. Governments considered four main options to achieve fiscal consolidation - wage bill cuts/caps, phasing out subsidies, further targeting social safety nets, and reforming old-age pensions - each of which would be likely to have a disproportionately negative impact on children and women. © 2013 Copyright IAFFE.","2-s2.0-84883561430","United States"

Nevertheless, the work characteristics had little explanatory value additional to the working hours. The association between working hours and parent-child time was weaker for mothers and for parents with young children. Moreover, the beneficial effect of non-standard hours was stronger for mothers and autonomy more relevant for parents with adolescent children. © The Author(s) 2012.","2-s2.0-84867928253","Netherlands"

The data, collected over an entire academic year, mainly comes from Kota's weekly reports on his classroom participation, interviews with Kota and with his course instructors, and classroom observations. Being informed by a 'community-of-practice' perspective and a social constructivist notion of identity and gender, findings suggest that differences in language, culture, and gender that were constructed within local academic communities impacted Kota's participation and socialization in significant ways. In particular, the kinds of identities Kota developed as well as the roles ascribed to him by others based on these differences contributed to his limited participation both inside and outside the classroom. At the same time, Kota dealt with his challenges proactively by employing various strategies. This study discusses these findings by triangulating multiple viewpoints.

We explore changes in household labor and gender relations when conservative, workingclass families experience employment disruptions. Using data from 49 qualitative interviews conducted with men and women following the forced unemployment of breadwinning husbands, we observe some change in gendered household labor but conclude that a significant degendering of housework is thwarted by institutional-, interactive-, and individual-level processes. At the institutional level, the lack of well-paying jobs and the persistent gendering of household tasks discourage change. At the individual level, challenges to gendered identities encourage a reinforcement of traditional gender ideologies. At the interactional level, women's responsibility for care work and the meaning of paid work for unemployed husbands forestall the adjustment of tasks. © 2010 by The Author(s).","2-s2.0-77955295737","United States"
"753",2009,"Hawwa","The socialization of female Islamists: Paternal and educational influence","Many women have played an important role in Islamic renewal as advocates and activists within Islamist movements and parties. Women's participation is of particular interest, given the reputation of these groups as insufficiently supportive of women's rights. The specific influences and experiences that lead women to approach their own empowerment through Islam and to reform Islamist movements from within have been neglected. This article investigates some of the important influences on two prominent female Islamists: Heba Raouf Ezzat, Professor of Political Science at Cairo University, and Nadia Yassine, founder and head of the women's branch of the Moroccan movement Justice and Spirituality (JSA). First and foremost, it overviews the circumstances in which prominent women in Egypt and Morocco have asserted themselves in the past century, highlighting the consistent importance of paternal influence and the expansion of access to education, as well as the evolving role of religion and religious discourse in arguments for women's rights. This article discusses the role of paternal influence and schooling as agents of political socialization, pointing out that scholars have underestimated the important role that fathers play in strongly patriarchal societies and the ability of schools in former colonies to produce anti colonial and nationalist political sentiments. It then turns to Ezzat and Yassine themselves, presenting in detail the influence their fathers and foreign schools had on their political socialization. Both fathers held progressive views on women's education, but they differed in their specific political views, such as their attitude towards Islamism, and the extent to which they sought to transfer their political views to their daughters. This article ends by discussing the role of foreign education in Ezzat's and Yassine's socialization and identity construction, emphasizing the importance of encounters with racist and condescending attitudes as a contributing factor to women's search for Islamic alternatives. © 2009 BRILL.","2-s2.0-67650264639","United States"

To this end, a concept broader than mere duration of work time is constructed. This concept, which we call time availability, encompasses not only the volume of hours worked but also the scheduling and predictability of those hours. It is measured by a synthetic indicator showing the extent to which a given group of workers exceeds the societal time norm. After a presentation of the French context, we show that women seem to have less time availability, particularly at the ages that are most decisive in career terms. But these differences do not concern the same aspects of time availability. Thus the time constraints experienced mainly by women are less socially visible and hence undervalued by employers. This lower visibility comes, for a large part, from the social perception of women professionals. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-67649359930","France"

We measured sexist beliefs and romantic relationship experience in a large sample of Spanish adolescents (N=1447), ranging from 12 to 19 years of age. Consistent with prior research, age predicted less sexist beliefs. Controlling for the effects of age, relationship experience predicted increased hostile sexism in girls and increased benevolent sexism in boys. Additionally, younger boys (12-14 years) with greater relationship experience tended to endorse hostile sexism more strongly. The general decline in sexism over the course of adolescence masks a contrasting effect of romantic experience, which suggests that heterosexual adolescents' desire to attract romantic partners may foster, rather than reduce, sexism. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-77955716023","United States"

The use of an evolutionarily and environmentally informed feminist perspective presents a better approach to understanding earlier fertility timing and designing prevention programs that address the contexts to which individuals adaptively respond by engaging in behavior that our society deems to be “risky.” This paper documents the major correlates to earlier fertility timing, poverty, and health status within context and suggests that the targets of prevention programs should not only include individual adolescent behavior but also consider their contextual circumstances.

"758",2016,"Human Studies","Constructing Gender Incommensurability in Competitive Sport: Sex/Gender Testing and the New Regulations on Female Hyperandrogenism","The segregation of the sexes in sport still seems to be regarded as a matter of course. In contrast to other performance classes, e.g., age and weight, which are constructed on the grounds of directly relevant performance features, in the case of gender it is dealt with the merely statistical factor that women on average perform less well than men. And yet unlike weight or age classes, which can be interchanged if the required performances are provided, the segregation between the sexes in many types of sport seems to be quite impermeable. Contrary to popular beliefs women were not excluded from the beginning of modern sport. Hence, the meaning of gender differences varies in the course of time and in types of sport. Thus, this paper firstly gives a short summary of the different relevance of gender differences in high performance competitions of various types of sport. Then the historical construction of gender as central dimension in modern sport will be illustrated by using the example of soccer. Here in this paper, the elaborate processes of reproducing this incommensurability between women and men in sport is the main focus: At first big sport organisations tried to exclude women whose performances were well above the expectations by establishing so called “Gender verifications” which suspected them of fraud. Although it became certain that there is no clear differentiation between the sexes, gender segregation was not abolished. Instead new regulations have been invented to treat and “normalise” people who are difficult to categorise, e.g., transsexuals and women with Hyperandrogenism, in order to subsume them into the existent gender categories. So finally, gender segregation in sport seems to be just another example for Goffman’s institutional reflexivity: While the separation of the competitions are said to be a natural consequence of the differences between men and women, it actually is just a tool to create those differences. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84961198250","Germany"

We explored the relation between conduct problems and inhibitory deficits in a community sample. Three domains of inhibition were explored in 54 adolescents with conduct problems compared to 53 age, IQ, sex, school, and ethnicity matched controls in 2 geographical areas. Motor response inhibition was assessed using the Stop task, verbal inhibition using the Hayling Sentence Completion test, and cognitive interference inhibition using the Stroop task. Adolescents with conduct problems showed deficits in executive and inhibitory processes of the motor response inhibition task, but were unimpaired in cognitive or verbal inhibitory control. No sex differences were observed and impairments were independent of IQ or geographical location. Findings suggest that motor deficits, rather than higher cognitive forms of inhibitory control, are a specific deficit in children with conduct problems, that girls are as affected as boys, and that motor impulsiveness is a dimensional trait associated with conduct problems, as it is also observed in the community.

"762",2013,"Psychology of Women Quarterly","Math and Science Attitudes and Achievement at the Intersection of Gender and Ethnicity","Despite gender similarities in math and science achievement, women continue to be underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. Increasingly, researchers are looking to gender differences in STEM attitudes as the root of this disparity. Theoretical support for the importance of STEM attitudes comes from several theories within educational, social, and vocational psychology, including Eccles' expectancy-value theory, which maintains that education-related choices are shaped by attitudes-namely, expectations of success and task value as well as self-concept. Yet, the studies testing this model generally have not taken into account the intersection of gender and ethnicity. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by describing gender differences in math and science attitudes and achievement among 367 White, African American, Latino/Latina, and Asian American 10th grade students in neighborhood public high schools from a large northeastern city. Male and female adolescents earned similar end-of-year grades in math and science, whereas Asian American students outperformed students from the other ethnic groups in math and science. Self-report data from paper-and-pencil surveys indicate significant gender differences in that male adolescents reported greater math self-concept and expectations of success and female adolescents reported more science value; gender differences did not vary across ethnic groups. Attitudes were strong predictors of achievement, consistent with hypotheses. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine math and science attitudes and achievement at the intersection of gender and ethnicity across four major ethnic groups. We discuss implications for efforts aimed at improving the representation of women in STEM. © The Author(s) 2013.","2-s2.0-84880777703","United States"

The aim of this study is to describe young women's attitude toward gender-equitable norms. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Trivandrum, using multistage cluster sampling method. Participants were 18-28-year-old married (n = 203) and unmarried (n = 104) women. The scales of domestic chores and daily life domain items and violence domain items from the compendium of gender scales were used to assess the attitude toward gender-equitable norms. Pearson Chi-square test was used to check the significance of the associations. RESULTS: The high support to gender-equitable norms on domestic chores and daily life domain was 29% and 18% and violence domain was 25% and 14% among unmarried and married women, respectively. Education was interrupted among 55% of married women due to marriage, pregnancy, childcare, and lack of resources. The ability to take final decision to work outside the home (32% vs. 45%) and in obtaining health care (65% vs. 73%) was low among married women compared to unmarried women. Higher education did not affect the attitude of young women toward gender-equitable norms on 'violence domain,' but the highly educated married women showed a slightly better support for 'domestic chores and daily life domain' and had a major say in taking decisions on health-care seeking and work outside home. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the support for gender-equitable norms and the freedom in decision-making are not satisfactory among young women. Education alone cannot make rapid changes in the attitude of young women toward gender-equitable norms since it is strongly connected with social norms and practices. © 2019 Journal of Education and Health Promotion Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","2-s2.0-85064750716","India"
"765",2011,"Sexuality and Culture","'Wine', Women and Song: The More Things Change...","The paper addresses the socially controversial issue of the public expression of sexuality in dance in the Caribbean. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of 'wining' or 'wukkin' up', dancing involving pelvic gyrations. The focus is on changes taking place in societies in which there is supposedly the continued dominance of a male patriarchal figure. Can these changes be anything more than a new form of male control of female sexuality and public sexual expression? It seeks to address this question through an analysis of two songs, one a male performed classic competition winning calypso, 'The Black Man feeling to party' and a competition winning calypso sung by a female entitled 'This is what we do'. The former celebrates heterosexual relationships right from the period of partner dancing courtship, through marriage, child rearing and, with child rearing achieved, a return to partner dancing. The latter exalts and justifies the behaviour of women 'wining' alone or on each other. The paper concludes that women are asserting ownership of their own sexuality through auto-sexual dance expression in public.

It extends the theory of the slender body originally outlined by Susan Bordo to propose that the “obesity epidemic” morally regulates female bodies according to a moderation-reward-entitlement system. This architecture describes the way that individuals become useful to the state and to themselves, with the promise of reward for obedient behavior. Specifically, I argue that slenderness, as an ascetic practice of moderation, grants the female subject a range of entitlements—to femininity, to the middle class, to national belonging—the reward for which is happiness. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84957600165","Australia"

Results revealed that adolescents from divorced/separated families and those from intact families did not differ in their reported levels of shame or guilt. Guilt increased with age, but the developmental progression of shame varied by gender. Girls reported more guilt and shame than did boys. Examination of family closeness revealed that guilt was positively correlated with mother, father, and sibling closeness for boys and girls. Shame was unrelated to family closeness except girls' shame scores correlated with sibling-closeness and guilt-free shame was related to boys' father-closeness. These findings point to the importance of family closeness, and particularly of opposite-gender parent-child relationships as well as sibling relationships, in adolescents' guilt-proneness. © NAJP.","2-s2.0-34347269651","United States"

On some trials, participants matched either good or bad words with a feminist or a traditionalist target person. On other trials, they matched feminine or masculine traits with these targets. We predicted (1) faster reaction times to feminist-bad pairings than to feminist-good pairings, (2) faster reactions to traditionalist-good pairings than to traditionalist-bad pairings, (3) faster reactions to traditionalist-feminine pairings than to traditionalist-masculine pairings, and (4) faster reactions to feminist-masculine pairings than to feminist-feminine pairings. The results supported the first three predictions. These results suggest an implicit negativity bias and masculinity bias towards feminists and an implicit positivity bias and femininity bias towards traditionalists. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","2-s2.0-58149105925","United States"

However, the sex differences in stroke outcome among patients with diabetes are unknown. Therefore, we aimed to assess the sex differences in long-term prognosis among acute ischemic stroke patients with diabetes. Methods: The ischemic stroke patients with diabetes were recruited to this study between May 2005 and September 2014 in Tianjin, China. Sex differences in mortality, dependency (modified rank scale > 2), and recurrence at 3, 12, and 36 months after stroke were analyzed. Results: A total of 2360 patients were recruited in this study. The age of stroke onset, National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), and modified rank scale (mRS) on admission were greater in women than in men (P < 0.05). Women were more likely to have hypertension, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and dyslipidemias. In contrast, men were more likely to have artery stenosis, current smoking, and alcohol consumption (P < 0.001). There was higher mortality in women than in men at 3 months (7.9 % vs 5.2 %), 12 months (12.2 % vs 8.2 %), and 36 months (21.9 % vs 16.1 %) after stroke; but no differences were found in dependency and recurrence. Sex differences were found in associated factors of outcomes by time-point. Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) of large artery atherothrombosis (LAA), cardioembolism (CE), and smoking were risk factors of outcomes in women at short term and medium term; but atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, and alcohol were risk factors of outcomes in men at medium term and long term. Conclusions: These findings suggest that it is crucial to establish the individual scheme of therapy for every patient by different risk factors of stroke, strengthen the rehabilitation of stroke, and carry on the health education early for the secondary prevention of stroke in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). © 2015 Zhao et al.","2-s2.0-84949266478","China"

To investigate this assumption, the present study was designed to analyze university student politeness levels in Japan and South Korea when they (i.e., speakers) asked various people (i.e., listeners) to purchase a concert ticket. A decision tree analysis revealed hierarchies of factors predictive of politeness levels specific to young Japanese and Koreans. Among Japanese, distance (i.e., extent to which speaker and listener are acquainted) was the strongest followed by power (i.e., extent of disparity in social status) and gender-identity/gender-congruence. Among Koreans, however, power appeared to override distance, resulting in the descending order of power and gender-identity/gender-congruence. Regarding gender-related factors, the results of these parallel studies in Japan and South Korea generally suggested a distinctive influence of gender-identity on politeness levels when listeners held equal or lesser power than speakers, while gendercongruence was implicated when listeners held greater power. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.","2-s2.0-74549181069","Japan"
"777",2016,"International Journal of Applied Linguistics and English Literature","Gender and speech in a Disney princess movie","One of the latest Disney princess movies is Frozen which was released in 2013. Female characters in Frozen differ from the female characters in previous Disney movies, such as The Little Mermaid and Tangled. In comparison, female characters in Frozen are portrayed as having more heroic values and norms, which makes it interesting to examine their speech characteristics. Do they use typical female speech despite having more heroic characteristics? This paper aims to provide insights into the female speech characteristics in this movie based on Lakoff’s (1975) model of female speech. Data analysis shows that female and male characters in the movie used almost equal number of female speech elements in their dialogues. Interestingly, although female characters in the movie do not behave stereotypically, their speech still contain the elements of female speech, such as the use empty adjectives, questions, hedges and intensifier. This paper argues that the blurring of boundaries between male and female speech characteristics in this movie is an attempt to break gender stereotyping by showing that female characters share similar characteristics with heroic male characters thus they should not be seen as inferior to the male characters. © 2016, Australian International Academic Centre PTY LTD.

Finally, a more radical proposal is presented: substituting """"stage"""" with """"position"""" in clinically understanding both Oedipus and adolescence - a negotiation between ego, anxieties, and defenses; a structural rather than temporal model in which tumultuous triadic and intrapsychic negotiations take precedence in a particular developmental era and then remain in place dialectically throughout life.

Baker is a careful and perceptive reader of both the primary tannaitic sources that she discusses and of the material record. In fact, the body of the book, in which she discusses the domestic context (well titled “The Well-Ordered Bayit: Bodies, Houses and Rabbis in the Ancient Galilee”) and the marketplace (“Men, Women and the Shuk: Cultural Currencies on the Open Market”) is a well-written description and analysis of the preserved evidence. Baker shows, for example, that rabbinic notions of privacy and the placement of windows within extant structures reflect similar interests. More important, she shows the ways that various spaces, both public and private, were used by ancient Jewish women, and how gender issues played out within environments constructed by Jewish men and women in Roman Palestine. The impetus for this study was not ultimately Rabbinic literature or archaeology, however. It is what Baker sees as a misconception in recent scholarship. Baker argues against a position whereby Jewish women in antiquity were starkly limited to the domestic realm, while the public realm (and even elements of the private) were reserved for men. © 2005, Cambridge University Press.

Through an analysis of journal articles referencing GST, we explored the breadth of the theory’s reach and the ways in which its use has changed over time. More specifically, we analyzed how often GST reached journals outside psychology as well as journals and research populations outside the United States, even though Bem was a U.S. psychologist whose empirical work was primarily with U.S. populations. We also assessed the range of research topics that have used a GST framework. We found that 34 years later, GST continues to be cited frequently, with a broad reach beyond U.S. psychology, particularly into international as well as communication and business journals. We found five primary novel uses of the theory: development, discrimination/stereotyping, occupations, historically marginalized populations, and mental health and trauma. We conclude that GST has been a generative theory. For the future, we recommend that GST be used to frame the study of intersectionality, for research-based activism, and as part of a project of theory-bridging. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84962244343","United States"

The study sought to (1) identify expectancies regarding sexting behaviors, (2) examine how demographics (i.e., gender, sexual identity, relationship status) might be differentially related to sexting expectancies and behaviors, and (3) examine whether these concurrent relationships are consistent with a theoretical causal model in which sexting expectancies influence sexting behaviors. The sample consisted of 278 undergraduate students (mean age=21.0 years, SD=4.56; 53.8% female; 76.3% caucasian). Factor analyses supported the validity and reliability of the Sextpectancies Measure (a=0.85-0.93 across subscales) and indicated two expectancy domains each for both sending and receiving sexts: positive expectancies (sexual-related and affect-related) and negative expectancies. Males reported stronger positive expectancies (F=4.64, p=0.03) while females reported stronger negative expectancies (F=6.11, p=0.01) about receiving sexts. There were also differences across relationship status regarding negative expectancies (F=2.25, p=0.05 for sending; F=4.24, p=0.002 for receiving). There were also significant effects of positive (F=45.98, p&lt;0.001 for sending, F=22.42, p&lt;0.001 for receiving) and negative expectancies (F=36.65, p=0.02 sending, F=14.41, p&lt;0.001 receiving) on sexting behaviors (<U+03B7>2 from 0.04-0.13). College students reported both positive and negative sextpectancies, although sextpectancies and sexting varied significantly across gender, race, sexual identity, and relationship status. Concurrent relationships were consistent with the causal model of sextpectancies influencing sexting behaviors, and this study serves as the first test of this model, which could inform future prevention strategies to mitigate sexting risks. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","2-s2.0-84882733527","United States"

As symptomatic media texts, the reality TV show points to the quandaries of evolving gender politics faced by singletons of China’s one-child generation within the country’s neoliberal restructuring. The textual evidence shows that male participants follow the rule of a market economic hierarchy and uphold the hegemonic ideal of versatile, successful, and upper-middle-class manhood, which hinges on the patriarchal, heteronormative model of love and marriage. Paradoxically, this disempowering ideal is reinforced by female participants in their relational reconstruction of masculinities. The article argues that the Chinese state media not only discipline masculinities but also naturalize a regressive gender mandate in alignment with neoliberal values and the state’s pursuit of capitalist economic development. Consequently, the multiple, hybridized versions of masculinities emerging in media discourse and popular parlance complicate the cultural repertoire of gender relations yet without challenging deeply entrenched structural gender inequality. © 2017 The Organization for Research on Women and Communication.","2-s2.0-85018272741","United States"

To improve this situation, an in-depth understanding of the importance of gender-responsive extension delivery is required. A case study of the Agricultural Development and Value Chain Enhancement Program that put in extra efforts to reach more female farmers with extension delivery and other rural advisory services was conducted. The study investigates how gender dynamics interact with the agricultural extension delivery with particular reference to the adoption of improved technologies. A total sample of 592 smallholder farmers were interviewed in selected communities in Northern Ghana. In addition to one-on-one interviews, 18 focus group discussions were also conducted in the surveyed districts. Study findings confirmed that male farmers had more access to agricultural extension delivery than their female counterparts because of their relatively better financial standing, large farm sizes, mobility to access extension and rural advisory service providers outside their communities. The study identified gendered associations with some crop types across all the study districts. However, the gendered extension delivery led to a new sociocultural order that seems to break down the gendered associations with the adoption of improved technologies. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85039157645","Ghana"

Methods. Using data from a subsample of 530 unmarried older adults and ordinary least squares regression, we estimated main and interactive effects of marital status, gender, and race on single strain. Results. Divorced and widowed persons reported higher single strain than never-married persons, although the magnitude of these effects varied considerably by race and gender. Never-married White women reported higher levels of single strain than their male counterparts. White widows and widowers exhibited higher single strain than widowed Black adults. Black women uniformly fared better than White women, whereas divorced and never-married Black men were not different from their White peers in terms of single strain. Discussion.

Through a reading of mid-century sexological studies against the background of structural-functionalist and behaviorist theories of social order, it shows how gender was born in the clinic to discipline the reproduction of life in new ways. The truth of sex was no longer found in the genitals or mind, but in the contingent cognitive processes of a behavioral control system. The gender apparatus produced systematized protocols for sex reassignment surgeries for infants with ambiguous genitalia and rendered the family a panoptic institution, all to ensure that children were socialized into normative gender roles guaranteeing the continued reproduction of the life of the species. The violence of this new life-administering technology was crystallized in the pedagogical techniques employed by physicians designed to persuade their child patients to submit themselves to the normalizing care of surgeons and psychiatrists. © The Author(s) 2013.","2-s2.0-84884484853","Finland"

Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses a case study approach using participant observation and semi-structured interviews. The authors' qualitative analysis is informed by feminist research methods. Findings - The authors identified a number of key areas around which resistance and accommodation to gender norms are produced: the visual, the vocal and collective action. Analysis of these revealed the everyday practices of academic identities, the gendering of knowledge, and feminist interventions. The authors found that the practices and debates of academic women in PME reflect the wider debates in academia. Originality/value - PME and its relationship with gender and feminism have rarely been studied. This paper begins that task.

In the recent research on digitalisation, scant attention has however been paid to the gender impact of these changes. This article addresses this gap by developing a gender perspective on digitalisation, considering how these developments interact with existing social inequalities and gender segregation patterns in the labour market. We identify two broad areas in which digitalisation has thus far had a pronounced effect on employment: the structure of employment (including occupational change and the task content of jobs) and forms of work (including employment relationships and work organisation). We find that, despite the profound changes in the labour market, traditional gender inequalities continue to reassert themselves on many dimensions. With standard employment declining in significance, the policy challenge is to include new forms of work in effective labour protection frameworks that promote equal access of women and men to quality jobs and their equal treatment at work. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","2-s2.0-85027308318","Belgium"

The present study longitudinally examined body change behaviors in preadolescents' friendship groups as predictors of preadolescents' own body change behaviors. It was predicted that peer socialization effects would vary according to the gender composition of preadolescents' friendship group. Method: Participants (N = 648, 48.8% female) were in grades 6 through 8 at Time 1 and reported their dieting and muscle-gaining behavior at three time points approximately 1 year apart. Friendship groups were identified from preadolescents' friendship nominations. Body mass index and pubertal timing were included in analyses as control variables. A multiple group latent growth curve model was used to examine hypotheses. Results: Socialization of body change behaviors in preadolescent friendship groups was observed only under certain conditions.

Despite the increasing interest of scientific literature and health intervention in the involvement of men, especially in the field of sexual and reproductive rights, comparatively, reflections and interventions directed at men who have committed violence against women have received far less attention from governmental and non-governmental institutions, and from the academy. The article presents some concepts and data on violence against women and provides an overview of the connection between gender, health and masculinities; it analyzes some studies that approach the subject of men and violence against women and shares some experiences carried out with men to prevent this form of violence; finally, it offers some final thoughts on the subject.","2-s2.0-69849117983","Brazil"
"797",2015,"Ethnography and Education","Towards a rural sociological imagination: ethnography and schooling in mobile modernity","In 1959, C. Wright Mills coined the phrase ‘the sociological imagination’ to offer a critical assessment of a discipline he saw descending into a technical or abstract empiricist practice that he feared would ultimately deepen human alienation and oppression. Mills positioned the sociologist as a careful, critical scholar working in the space between biography and history. In this paper, I offer a meta-ethnographic analysis of several recent critical ethnographies in the rural sociology of education using my own experience as a rural education ethnographer to frame the analysis. I argue that critical ethnographic work is crucial to developing educational analysis that is attuned to the nuances of place and the kind of metrocentric analysis that effectively ‘traps’ rural places in larger structural educational reform narratives. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84938421155","Australia"

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper. Findings: This study develops the notion of the Teflon effect to describe the way merit may go unrecognised and may therefore not “stick” to the bodies of women in management and leadership roles. Research limitations/implications: This study provides an explanation for the persistence of the glass ceiling and the barriers women face as they undertake or aspire to management and/or leadership positions in organisations. Practical implications: This study introduces a more embodied notion of merit which relies on both performance and recognition to “take effect”. Professionals must see beyond “objective” measures of merit in performance reviews and/or in recruitment and promotion decisions to include reflection on the significance of merit’s subjective, “performed” dimensions. Social implications: This study adds to understandings of women’s positioning in organisations. Originality/value: This study develops the notion of the Teflon effect. This highlights the significance of the recognition, performance and embodiment of merit and how merit may fail to adhere to the bodies of women in management and leadership roles. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2-s2.0-84992597308","United Kingdom"
"800",2009,"Gender and Society","Labor markets, breadwinning, and beliefs: How economic context shapes men's gender ideology","Abundant research has found that men's economic status shapes their gender ideology such that men who are breadwinners are less likely to endorse egalitarian ideology than men in nontraditional arrangements. This article investigates how the association between men's breadwinning status and gender ideology is influenced by the institutional arrangements of different types of labor markets. Rigid labor markets support men's ability to be breadwinners in the long term, whereas flexible labor markets provide men with more frequent, but less permanent, experiences of nontraditional arrangements. The authors anticipate that breadwinner status will have stronger effects on men's gender ideology in rigid labor markets because men can expect less fluctuation in their employment situations in those contexts. Results from a multilevel analysis of 27 countries indeed demonstrate that individual men's economic dependency on their partners influences men's gender egalitarian ideology more strongly in rigid labor markets than in flexible markets. © 2009 Sociologists for Women in Society.","2-s2.0-63749123622","United States"

Contemporary medical knowledge interpreted this as a spontaneous sex change; in fact underlying sex was being revealed. Such transformations came to be interpreted in dynastic histories and other official texts as omens of dynastic change; when the same stories appear in anomaly accounts, they are understood simply as curious or strange incidents. Intersex individuals were uniquely challenging to gender norms, and as such they provide an important focus of discussion about social attitudes towards appropriate roles and boundaries. From the late Ming dynasty onwards, particularly with the case of Li Liangyu, members of the literati elite in China began to do more than simply record the reintegration of intersex individuals into mainstream society through categorization into the opposite gender followed by marriage, as they started to consider the difficulties they suffered. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","2-s2.0-84907678847","South Korea"

Method: In a randomized controlled trial, 159 heterosexual young men (intervention groups, n = 113; control condition, n = 46) were exposed to 2 computer-delivered intervention arms, 1 targeting nonintenders (n = 36; motivational intervention arm) and the other targeting intenders (n = 77; volitional intervention arm). Intention and condom use were assessed through self-report questions at 3 points in time, each 2 weeks apart. Motivational intervention involved screen content requesting decisional balance for condom use and focus on past success to trigger self-efficacy. Volitional intervention encouraged the formation of specific if-then plans, where participants were required to choose and write about the most favourable situations by means of reflection on when, where, and how to carry them out, and of thinking about strategies for obstacles that might hinder condom use. Results: Experimental nonintenders obtained higher levels of condom use intention two weeks and one month later and of reported condom use one month later than control nonintenders. Experimental intenders reported an increase in condom use in comparison with control intenders one month later. Conclusions: At a 30-day follow-up, treatment was shown to have helped nonintenders to first increase their condom use intentions and later condom use, and intenders to improve condom use behavior. A stage-based computer-delivered intervention design including motivational and volitional treatment appears to be suitable for improving condom use motivation as well as behavior after a 1-month period. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84966702616","Poland"

Women and ethnic minority faculty in our study tend to be more proactive in building mentoring networks, and their networks generally consist of more diverse nodes compared to men and majority participants’ mentoring networks. Participants’ mentoring networks evolve as faculty move up academic ranks—assistant professors have extensive mentoring network with diverse mentor nodes; associate professors experience a shrinking of mentoring networks; and full professors assume the role of mentors in others’ mentoring networks.

Our results show that social background is strongly related to the level of education achieved while gender is found to have a stronger effect on the field of study selected. Countries vary in the extent to which gender and social background affect young people's outcomes. Gender differentiation in labour market outcomes reflects the nature of the welfare regime, being more pronounced in familial and conservative systems. Social inequality in educational attainment and early labour market outcomes are less marked in Finland and Sweden, reflecting the combination of less differentiated educational systems, mass higher education and social-democratic welfare regimes. In contrast, social inequality is more marked in the Eastern European countries, due partly to their highly differentiated educational systems but more notably to rapid changes taking place in post-communist systems.","2-s2.0-42149165563","Ireland"

However, surprisingly, this gender bias has not been investigated for suboptimal presentation of emotional expressions. Our first experiment aimed at investigating the existence of such a bias for very fast presentation of the stimulus (20 ms onset) on the basis of a classic priming procedure commonly used in affective priming studies that involved the use of a single prime. Our second experiment aimed at proposing a new method involving four fast, repeated presentations of the prime-target pairs (based on the innovative design proposed by Höschel and Irle), that could be used to reduce the gender bias in future studies in affective sciences. Results show that the classic procedure for subliminal affective priming seems, indeed, sensitive to gender bias, but that it is possible to maximise the affective effect and decrease the impact of the gender bias using repeated presentations of the prime. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84925276925","France"

The study aims to support and extend previous studies in relation to the heterogeneity of the gambling population based on gender and gambling type, and the implications of subgroup differences on treatment outcomes. Additionally, the concept of drop-out is addressed in terms of categorical treatment measures. The empirical findings are examined in the context of the theoretical framework of the pathways model. Participants were recruited from the Statewide Gambling Therapy Service and stratified into subgroups based on gender and gambling mode preference [Electronic Gambling Machines (EGM) or track race betters]. Baseline predictors collected and analysed using multinomial logistical regression included demographic information as well as gambling variables, while treatment outcomes consisted of three therapist rated measures. Significant differences between the subgroups were found for age, marital and employment status, gambling duration, alcohol use and the Kessler 10 measure of psychological distress. Specifically, male track race gamblers were younger, married, employed, had a longer duration of gambling, higher alcohol use and lower psychological distress relative to EGM users. No difference was found in any of the treatment outcomes, however, consistent with previous studies, all subgroups had high treatment incompletion levels. The findings demonstrate the importance of screening, assessing and treating problem gamblers as a heterogeneous group with different underlying demographics and psychopathologies.

Similarly, either/or reactions also seem to be applied by people dealing professionally with issues of transsexualism, transgenderism or related statuses. For instance, the history of transsexualism is characterised by attempts to classify transsexual people hierarchically and descriptively. The primary intention was to discriminate between different types of transsexualism to prescribe hormonal and surgical treatment for 'real' transsexual people and to recommend psychotherapy aiming at relieving gender dysphoria for all the others. In this regard, from the early beginnings sexologists have argued about the origins of transsexualism, because the type of origin - the professionals assumed - legitimises a specific kind of treatment, for example psychotherapy for psychological issues and somatic cross-sex treatment for biological issues. Consequently, psychoanalysts and biologically orientated professionals have debated at great lengths about state-of-the-art treatment for transsexual people. Furthermore, to pass as a 'real' transsexual, most of the people concerned presented themselves in a very schematic way. The main focus of this article is the long-standing history of either/or reactions in health care professionals dealing with issues of transsexualism and related states. In addition, it elaborates on the iatrogenic influence on the behaviour of transsexual people of the biases of health care professionals. Finally, in highlighting perspectives of recent trans theory, conclusions important for the debate of current issues are drawn and ideas for the future of care are developed. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-80053023171","Germany"

The aim of this paper is to evaluate critically these explanations in relation to women entrepreneurs in the informal sector in India. Design/methodology/approach – To evaluate the contrasting explanations of structuralist and new liberal approaches, questionnaire surveys were conducted in two phases, namely 2007 and 2010, over a period of several months. The sample design was stratified random and the sample was taken from a range of cities in different parts of India. Findings – The survey of 457 women entrepreneurs of the informal sector shows that although the structuralist representation is largely appropriate for women working as waged informal employees, it is not as valid for women informal entrepreneurs working on a self-employed basis. The results challenge the traditional understanding of the informal sector, and self-employed women in particular, and are discussed in the light of the institutional rational choice framework. Research limitations/implications – The analysis highlights how the decision of entrepreneurship does not stand in isolation from other decisions and choices, is in line with normative considerations, and is a collective rational choice for women entrepreneurs in the informal sector. This analysis is a first of its kind and calls for additional surveys to be undertaken of female (and male) informal entrepreneurs in other countries to establish this concept.

Methods: Samples of children, adolescents, undergraduates, and employees took part in this study (N = 10,478). They responded to the Arabic Scale of Insomnia (ASI). This scale has good psychometric parameters. Results: Male children obtained a significantly higher mean ASI score than did their female counterparts. However, female adolescents, undergraduates, and employees obtained significantly higher total mean ASI scores than did their male counterparts. The biggest gender difference was found among employees, whereas the smallest was in undergraduates. Female children obtained the lowest mean score on the ASI.

One possible explanation of the high score of adolescent, undergraduate, and employee females on insomnia is their higher scores on neuroticism, anxiety, and fear relative to their male peers.","2-s2.0-85029718403","Egypt"
"826",2018,"Men and Masculinities","Men’s Muscularity Image—The Role among Polish Young Population","For many young men, enhancing their attractiveness as perceived by the opposite sex could be a potential reason for beginning physical activity. The aim of the study was to assess how women perceive male muscularity and how it could affect social relations between sexes. The intention was also to compare this assessment with the male view of the issue. An anonymous survey was conducted in electronic form and shared to Polish students. The questionnaire was completed by 5,190 respondents (4,043 women and 1,147 men). Women preferred a less muscular body than men. All muscle groups apart from the buttocks were also rated as more important by men than by women. The social role of muscularity, for example, in forming relationships with women was exaggerated by men. Men’s perception of their muscularity is not coherent with the way females perceive it. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.","2-s2.0-85049907070","Poland"

Earlier research suggests that both males and females will react negatively to such ads because of perceptions of unethicality, manipulativeness, etc. However, we hypothesize and find that, under the sort of constrained processing conditions that allow the elicitation of spontaneous, gut-level reactions, men on average will exhibit a more positive attitudinal response to gratuitous sex appeals than women (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 then provides support for the underlying process - and also demonstrates intragender variation-by showing that women with more liberal attitudes to sex per se react in a manner very similar to men; namely, they report more liking for a sexual ad than a nonsexual ad. © 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology.","2-s2.0-44249087834","Canada"

Little research, however, has examined moderators of this relationship, including among men, whose appearance concerns are underresearched compared with women. Emotion regulation is one potential moderator that may be particularly compromised among men. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine the role of emotion dysregulation in the relationship of perfectionism with DAC among men. Participants were 106 undergraduate men who completed an online survey that included questions about DAC, difficulties in emotion regulation, perfectionism, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that increased emotional awareness and low impulse control were associated with DAC. Moreover, difficulties in emotion regulation moderated the relationship between perfectionism and DAC.

Moderated mediation growth curves were employed to examine harsh parenting as a mechanism underlying the link between maternal depression and children’s dysregulated representations using a nationally-representative, economically-vulnerable sample of mothers and their children (n = 575; 49% boys, 51% girls). Dysregulation representations were measured using the MacArthur Story Stem Battery at five years of age (M = 5.14, SD = 0.29). Harsh parenting mediated the association between early maternal depression and dysregulated representations for girls.

Rather than building on the rights-based development and best practices of the 1990s, they ignore the critical roles of political capacity and participation that the past forty years and feminist analysis of development achievements and failures have taught us are essential to taking on gender and economic inequality. Certain trends in foreign aid accountability share this silence on the importance of political capacity. In contrast, the rights-based approach to gender equality and development (RBA) is a political approach to development. We reconcile the need for aid accountability with the need for a focus on politics by outlining key political processes of the rights-based approach. The RBA is a way of doing development that is attentive to process and power. We can use the RBA not just as a guide for how to do development, but also as a way to think about processes as outcome measures. The processes that the RBA requires are processes that build capacity for marginalized women and people. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-84994154383","United States"

Using an eco-feminist perspective this article explores how the rhetoric of 'renewable energy for the poor' which bypasses women's voices and experience in domestic uses of renewable energy result in reverse outcomes of pro-environmental policy for the poor, as well as, for society in general. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 20 women in Lwandle, in South Africa, the article identifies three themes reflecting on how the women experience the installation of solar water heaters. The first theme discusses the exclusion of women from consultations as an endurance of environmental racism and sexism. Secondly, the findings reflect on how domestic labour and costs increase in the face of dysfunctional SWHs. I also discuss how the decision to install these geysers in shared bathrooms overrides residents' expressed needs for privacy and dignity. The third theme discusses the continued use of fossil fuels such as paraffin and its implication for household safety, expenditure and the environment.

Drawing upon oral history interviews carried out with individuals living in Leeds at the time of the murders, this article explores women’s accounts of their fears from the time. This offers the opportunity to explore the gender/fear nexus from the unique perspective of a clearly defined object of fear situated within a specific spatial and historical setting. Findings revealed a range of anticipated fear-related emotions and practices which confirm popular ‘high-fear’ motifs; however, narrative analysis of interviews also highlighted more nuanced articulations of resistance and fearlessness based upon class, place and biographies of violence, as well as the way in which women drew upon fear/fearlessness in their overall construction of self. It is argued that using narrative approaches is a valuable means of uncovering the complexity of fear of crime and more specifically provides renewed insight onto women’s fear. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2-s2.0-85028879497","United Kingdom"

Yet age, like gender, is routinely accomplished in daily life. Grandmothers and adult daughters simultaneously do age and gender as they support one another in managing paid work and domestic responsibilities. Drawing on ethnographic data and interviews with 90 single mothers and 30 grandmothers (babushki) in Russia, I explore intergenerational negotiations for support. Both single mothers and grandmothers are held accountable for doing gendered age, but labor and marriage markets tip the balance in favor of single mothers. Single mothers re-create youth privilege, finding their lives simpler with a babushka. Some grandmothers embrace newer discourses of femininity, challenging assumptions about age and family status that oblige them to perform care work. But most grandmothers do whatever they can to help daughters, feeling more dependent than ever on them because of the uncertainties of capitalism and the state's retrenchment. I contribute to theories of age and gender intersectionality by making visible both single mothers' youth privilege and grandmothers' unpaid, often devalued, care work. © 2011 by The Author(s).","2-s2.0-80052798988","United States"

A robust gender-effect that men outperform women in the Vandenberg & Kuse mental rotation task has been well documented over the last years. In addition it has been shown that training can positively influence the overall task-performance. Considering this, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether security screeners show better performance in the Mental Rotation Test (MRT) independently of gender. Forty-seven security screeners of both sexes from two German airports were examined with a computer based MRT. Their performance was compared to a large sample of control subjects. The well-known gender-effect favoring men on mental rotation was significant within the control group. However, the security screeners did not show any sex differences suggesting an effect of training and professional performance. Surprisingly this specialized group showed a lower level of overall MRT performance than the control participants.

The aim of this study is to explore how far such a concern can enhance the understanding of game-based learning. To this end, an ethnographic case study of a male English language learner at a Chinese university was conducted, with Harding's (1986) three levels of gender as the analytical tools, namely, gender symbolism, gender structure, and individual identity. The case study produced differentiated gender symbols of big and small games. It was found that rather than seeing game playing as a way to facilitate his language learning, the student participated in big game playing as a way to socialize with the masculine world around him. This participation stopped short of contexts with different gender structures such as at home and in the labor market. The author concludes that Harding's critical theory of gender provides a nuanced understanding of the complex relation between gender and game-based learning.

Studying gender equity as an organizational value provided a way of understanding how gender inequity is perpetuated and embedded in the culture of an organization. This study was informed by post-structuralist feminist theory as it provided a lens for understanding and critiquing the local meanings and production of gendered knowledge, and encouraged discussion of transforming meanings and practices. This study was situated in a Canadian university athletic department in which gender equity was an espoused organizational value, but gender inequities were evident. Data were collected from in-depth interviews with administrators, coaches and athletes, observations of practices and competitions, and the analysis of relevant documents. These data were coded and categorized using Atlas.ti. Respondents' explanations for the gap between what was espoused and what was enacted centred on two dominant, but contradictory, themes: a denial of gender inequities and a rationalization of gender inequities. These themes suggested respondents often understood inequities as expected, natural, or normal. © 2007 The Author(s); Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2-s2.0-34247143399","Canada"

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine how gender and culture affect business creation, how women perceive social capital, and how important their personal networks are for their businesses, especially in the context of patriarchal societies. Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women entrepreneurs living and operating businesses in Turkey and in four countries of the Middle East and North African region, namely, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Egypt. Findings -The results indicate that being a woman entrepreneur in a highly patriarchal society limits entrepreneurial activities due to culture and social norms. However, networking appears as the key factor for these women entrepreneurs to overcome the barriers that they face, such as access to capital, financial information, resources, and new business opportunities. Research limitations/implications -This study has limitations that tend to be commonly found in exploratory studies, so you cannot make generalizations. However, the findings lay the groundwork for future studies to examine the role of networking activity in female entrepreneurship in the context of patriarchal societies. Practical implications -The findings are helpful for policymakers and other social groups interested in improving the conditions for female entrepreneurship. Governments and other economic actors need to provide training in both management and networking skills, encourage local businesses and associations to provide their venues for networking opportunities, and also provide support to women business organizations. Social implications - Women's entrepreneurship is growing, but still there is a scarcity of scholarly literature on the women entrepreneurs and their entrepreneurial activity.

Self and peer reports were completed by a convenience sample of 75 pairs of same gender female friends (N = 150) from a small undergraduate university in Eastern Canada. In a conceptual replication of previous research, we first showed that self-reports of perceived pressure to be thin significantly predicted women's own body image concerns when controlling for body mass. Of interest was the finding that body-related talk between friends that focused on exercise significantly predicted less body dissatisfaction. Additionally, by examining the relationships between self and peer reports, we showed that women's perceptions of their friends' body image concerns aligned to both self-reports and to friends' actual reports suggesting that women likely projected their own self-views when perceiving friends. Moreover, using multiple regression analyses, we demonstrated that perceptions of friends, and not friends' actual reports, predicted own body concerns. Besides the suggestions for future research stemming from limitations of the present study, we suggest that researchers interested in similarities between friends on women's body image concerns include both perceptions of peers and actual peer reports. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84873525802","Canada"
"853",2006,"Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal","Gender differences in job orientation: The case of Poland","Purpose – This survey-based study examines gender-based perspectives of job orientation, expectations, and motivations in the country of Poland. Design/methodology/approach – Polish professionals were asked to rate 25 job characteristics according to their importance to the rater on a five-point scale (5<U+2009>=<U+2009>very important, 1<U+2009>=<U+2009>not important). Mean scores were calculated and rank ordered for males and females separately. Two-tailed t-tests between male and female scores for each item tested for significant differences. A principle components factor analysis with rotation by the varimax method was performed on the correlation matrix of the 25 job characteristics. Findings – Results show that males and females differ on 15 of the 25 job characteristics. Standard deviations of the importance ratings were examined. They were higher for males on 21 of 25 items, with a mean standard deviation of 0.96 for males and 0.87 for females. A paired t-test ((1-(2<U+2009>=<U+2009>0)) resulted in rejecting the null hypothesis (p<U+2009>=<U+2009>0.001). Thus, for the respondents in this study, females as a group are significantly more homogeneous than are the males. Results of factor analysis with orthogonal rotation by the varimax method produced three factors of eigenvalues greater than 1.5, accounting for 37.3 per cent of the total variance. Factor I accounted for 17.9 per cent of the total variance and includes six job characteristics related to long term career objectives. Factor II deals with characteristics which can be classified as intellectual activity and explained 12.7 per cent of the total variance. Factor III included four characteristics related to structure and accounted for 6.7 per cent of the variance. Research limitations/implications – It would be worthwhile to extend the survey in the future to address three key issues: 1 – group respondents by years of service, for example, less than 5 years, more than 10 years, and so forth; 2 – control for salary levels; 3 – adjust for changes in the unemployment rate. Practical implications – This research indicates that even though money is an important motivator (number 1 for males and number 5 for females), there are certainly other methods of motivation beyond financial ones. This is particularly significant for foreign corporations investing in Poland. Such knowledge should provide organizations that use it as a competitive advantage not tied exclusively to monetary outlays. Originality/value – Poland is a developing economy which many observers believe is the most attractive emerging market in the expanding European Union. As such, the findings here should help organizations, both endogenous and exogenous, attract and retain employees. © 2006, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-84986052371","Poland"

Although considerable consensus appears to exist about issues that junior women face and institutional policies to help alleviate those issues, few respondents have ideas about how to improve the situation for senior STEM academic women scientists.Practical and social implications: Just as a loss in the percentage of women in the STEM workforce occurs at each higher level on the career ladder, women in the academic STEM professoriate also decrease at higher ranks. Many educational institutions have adopted policies and practices such as parental leave and stop the tenure clock, heralded as significant for attracting and retaining women in academic science, particularly at the junior level.

"855",2012,"Journal of Bisexuality","The Price of 'Community' From Bisexual/Biracial Women's Perspectives","When the words 'identity' or 'community' are evoked, a homogenizing process forms for the sake of community coherence. This article is based upon interviews with nine bisexual and mixed race participants about their conceptualization of identity-based communities. All participants expressed discontent with the 'established' gay and lesbian community for being monolithically White in racial composition and also biphobic. More than one half of the participants had been involved in queer Asian American women's organizations, within which they felt the least conflict and the most inclusion. The ideals of identity-based organizations have only sporadically manifested themselves for the bisexual-biracial women who are otherwise marginalized, silenced or excluded. Because their diverse needs and identities are not represented within these organizations, many of the participants felt they gave more than they received. Finding that communities based upon narrow identity clusters were not ideal, the participants created diverse communities based upon their expanded interests and identities. These bisexual-biracial women have revolutionized their personal concepts of community as they integrated the ideals of identity politics yet moved to include individuals who share similar progressive politics, responsibility and acceptance. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84865982572","United States"
"856",2019,"Journal of Religion and Health","Analytical Review of Contemporary Fatwas in Resolving Biomedical Issues Over Gender Ambiguity","Issues of gender ambiguity have been discussed over time from both Islamic and medical perspectives. In Islam, these issues are typically considered in the context of khunuthah (literally translated as hermaphroditism). While biomedical studies have appeared to provide a large amount of information on abnormal human biological development, i.e. Disorders of Sex Development (DSDs). However, the connection between these two fields has been given little attention. This research aims to determine the Islamic underpinnings through the fatwa around the globe. Thus, institutional fatwa organisations among Sunni schools of thought at the international, regional and national levels are observed. The fatwas regarding the management of individuals with gender ambiguity, not specifically on DSDs, are chosen and presented accordingly. Based on the findings, the sporadic fatwas from different parts of the world delineate the issue of sex ambiguity and seem to be able to provide general guidelines for management of Muslim patients with DSDs. Three common aspects have been discussed including the methodology of gender assignment, the decision-making process and the surgical and hormonal treatments. © 2018, The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85045743265","United Kingdom"

In this paper I use the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey from 1996 through 2002 to ask whether this helped to reduce the gender wage gap. I first focus on those whose wages are paid in full. Next, I ask about the gender composition of wage arrears as the overall extent of wage arrears dropped from 60 to 20 per cent after the 1998 crisis. I show that a temporary widening of the overall gender wage gap in 2000 is due to low-wage women becoming more likely to receive their wages in full than low-wage men. Except for this effect, the male-female pay difference in Russia exhibits a stable pattern. © 2007 The AuthorJournal compilation © 2007 The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.","2-s2.0-33947714364","Czech Republic"

There are few studies concerning the type and the prevalence of psychiatric-psychosomatic distress in patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate psychiatric-psychosomatic comorbidities, in particular anxiety, depression, somatization symptoms, and alexithymia, in a group of BPPV patients compared with healthy subjects, and according to gender. Methods: Case-control study comparing 92 BPPV patients recruited at the ENT Unit of Modena General Hospital between November 2007 and December 2010, and 141 healthy controls. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) were used to perform psychometric assessment. Results: BPPV patients scored higher than controls, with statistical significance, at BDI, BSI somatization, anxiety, and phobic anxiety subscales, and STAI state anxiety; a larger proportion of BPPV patients suffered from clinically significant BDI depressive symptomatology; DCPR disease phobia, functional somatic symptoms secondary to a psychiatric disorder, and demoralization were more common among BPPV subjects. High levels of symptomatology were still found among BPPV female patients, but not among males, even after controlling for symptom severity. Conclusions: Affective symptomatology, such as depression, demoralization, phobia and anxiety, and somatization, were significantly prevalent in BPPV patients, and female gender may be a predisposing factor. © 2014 Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine.","2-s2.0-84899653269","Italy"

Using robbery and physical assault data from the National Crime Victimization Survey for 1992 through 2000, this paper found that victims 65 years of age and older were much more likely to require medical care for their injuries compared to younger victims. When multivariate models were examined to predict injury, it was found the effects of verbal and/or other pas-sive forms of self-protective behavior decreased the probability of injury for the elderly against both known and unknown offenders. When elders were attacked by strangers, the effects of physical resistance strategies also served to decrease the probability of injury. However, when the offender was known, such as a family member or a friend, the use of physical forms of resistance increased the probability of injury for elderly victims, particularly female victims. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

"861",2016,"Behavioral Sciences","A longitudinal study of sexual entitlement and self-efficacy among young women and men: Gender differences and associations with age and sexual experience","Many scholars have called for an increased focus on positive aspects of sexual health and sexuality. Using a longitudinal design with two assessments, we investigated patterns of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure and self-efficacy to achieve sexual pleasure among 295 young men and women aged 17-25 years attending one Australian university. We also tested whether entitlement and efficacy differed by gender, and hypothesized that entitlement and efficacy would be higher in older participants and those with more sexual experience. A sense of entitlement to sexual partner pleasure increased significantly over the year of the study, whereas, on average, there was no change in self-efficacy over time. At Time 1 (T1), young women reported more entitlement than young men. Age was positively associated with T1 entitlement, and experience with a wider range of partnered sexual behaviors was concurrently associated with more entitlement and efficacy and was also associated with increased entitlement to partner pleasure and increased self-efficacy in achieving sexual pleasure at T2 relative to T1. A group with the least amount of sexual experience was particularly low in entitlement and efficacy when compared to groups with a history of coital experience. There was no evidence that any association differed between young men and young women. Limitations of the study include a sample of predominantly middle class, Caucasian students at one university and the possibility that students more interested in sex and relationships, and with more sexual experience, chose to participate. © 2017 by the author.","2-s2.0-85048693115","Canada"

"866",2011,"Social Science and Medicine","Understanding how race/ethnicity and gender define age-trajectories of disability: An intersectionality approach","A number of studies have demonstrated wide disparities in health among racial/ethnic groups and by gender, yet few have examined how race/ethnicity and gender intersect or combine to affect the health of older adults. The tendency of prior research to treat race/ethnicity and gender separately has potentially obscured important differences in how health is produced and maintained, undermining efforts to eliminate health disparities. The current study extends previous research by taking an intersectionality approach (Mullings & Schulz, 2006), grounded in life course theory, conceptualizing and modeling trajectories of functional limitations as dynamic life course processes that are jointly and simultaneously defined by race/ethnicity and gender. Data from the nationally representative 1994-2006 US Health and Retirement Study and growth curve models are utilized to examine racial/ethnic/gender differences in intra-individual change in functional limitations among White, Black and Mexican American Men and Women, and the extent to which differences in life course capital account for group disparities in initial health status and rates of change with age. Results support an intersectionality approach, with all demographic groups exhibiting worse functional limitation trajectories than White Men. Whereas White Men had the lowest disability levels at baseline, White Women and racial/ethnic minority Men had intermediate disability levels and Black and Hispanic Women had the highest disability levels. These health disparities remained stable with age-except among Black Women who experience a trajectory of accelerated disablement. Dissimilar early life social origins, adult socioeconomic status, marital status, and health behaviors explain the racial/ethnic disparities in functional limitations among Men but only partially explain the disparities among Women. Net of controls for life course capital, Women of all racial/ethnic groups have higher levels of functional limitations relative to White Men and Men of the same race/ethnicity. Findings highlight the utility of an intersectionality approach to understanding health disparities. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","2-s2.0-79954883104","United States"

This article examines practices that support as well as undermine GSS in two primary schools in Kirinyaga County, Kenya. In these schools, individual teacher agency was the main factor enhancing GSS. Teachers’ efforts were, however, constrained by competing discourses emphasizing hierarchical administration and a narrow understanding of the school’s responsibilities. Teacher agency, therefore, was insufficient to systematically protect students and foster gender equity. The article suggests that teacher agency to enhance GSS in Kenya could be expanded through teachers’ collective empowerment using community-based networks alongside the integration of monitoring and evaluation processes in existing gender equality and child protection policies. It further recommends the GSS framework as a means for monitoring SDG 4’s commitments to gender equality and child protection in schools. © 2019 by the author.

It offers an alternative viewpoint as most available discourses propose interpretations of Muslim women by focusing on travel experiences of the Arab Muslim woman. Based on in-depth interviews with 10 Asian Muslim women travellers aged between 22 and 37 years old from four different countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia), the findings were explored and explained from three dimensions of empowerment proposed by Kabeer namely resources, agency and achievements. Research findings show that Muslim women in Asia are travelling without abandoning their cultural or religious beliefs. The proliferation of Muslim women travellers contests the view that gendered interpretations of religious texts promote patriarchal orientation in Muslim community that suppresses women leisure. In a way, this paper challenges the continuous misconceptions about Islam and travel among Muslim women.

First, it intends to analyze the influence of human capital and social capital on the second of the stages in the process of entrepreneurial creation established by Shane and Venkataraman, the discovery of opportunities for creating a business. Second, it aims to analyze the existence of gender differences both in the discovery of opportunities and in the stock of human and social capital possessed by men and women. Design/methodology/approach:The authors use data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Spanish Project. From arandom sample of 28,888 individuals, which isrepresentative of the whole of the Spanish population between the ages of 18 and 64, the opinion of 1,473 active entrepreneurs has been gained. Also, logistic regressions were used as a statistical method to test the hypotheses proposed. Findings: The results indicate that individuals possessing a greater stock of human capital, as well as those who are highly involved in broad social networks, discover more chances of business creation. Similarly, this work shows that men discover more business opportunities and possess more human and social capital than women. Research limitations/ implications: The results obtained allow the authorsto makea contribution to the literature about the influence that human and social capital exerts on the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities. Regarding gender, the main contribution of the work is that gender differences exist both in the discovery of opportunities and in the stocks of human and social capital possessed by individuals. The main limitation of the paper is the difficulty of directly measuring variables used and thus the need to use """"proxy"""" variables. Practical implications: The results of the paper can help politicians and educators to enhance endeavours to increase attention to human and social factors and gender differences, in order to develop the second of the stages in the process of entrepreneurial creation, the discovery of opportunities for creating a business. Originality/value: In line with the findings and research implications, the paper provides additional proofs of why gender differences exist with regard to the entrepreneurial process, in part related to differences in human and social capital. However, other factors apart from the different stocks of human and social capital could explain this phenomenon, so a new line of research is necessary. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.""","2-s2.0-80052244768","Spain"

Gender differences are important factors that influence symptoms and behavioral responses. This research aimed to investigate gender differences in pain behaviors and pain management of chronic low back pain. The sample consisted of 158 participants (66.5% female), aged 30-88 who were diagnosed with Lumbar Osteoarthritis. The instruments used were the Visual Analogue Scale, the Quality of Life Questionnaire and a questionnaire to assess leisure and distraction activities from pain. Results of MANOVA showed that women have significant greater pain perception than men. Higher frequencies of social activities were also observed for women as well as significant correlations between social activities and psychological, social and environmental domains. In conclusion, women presented a greater number of coping strategies for pain than men, which probably tend to have a positive influence in their life quality. © 2016 Acta Colombiana de Psicologia.

"886",2018,"Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders","Intestinal microbiota, metabolome and gender dimorphism in autism spectrum disorders","There is a male predominance in autism, with a male/female ratio of 4:1 and an even higher ratio (11:1) in individuals with high functioning autism. The reasons for gender differences in ASD are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated, but no definitive evidence exists to explain male predominance. In this review, evidence is presented to support a hypothesis that the intestinal microbiota and metabolome play a role in gender dimorphism in children with autism. Metabolic products may affect not only gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central nervous system, but also behavior, supporting communication between GI tract and central nervous system. Furthermore, mood and anxiety may affect intestinal function, indicating bidirectional flow in the gut-brain axis. Several hormone-based hypotheses are discussed to explain the prevalence of autism in males. Observations in animal models and studies in humans on the intestinal microbiome and metabolome are reviewed to support the proposed gender dimorphism hypothesis. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiome is a contributing factor to the prevalence of ASD in boys either directly, through microbial metabolites and/or epigenetic factors capable of regulating host gene expression through DNA methylation and/or histone modification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2-s2.0-85042449865","United States"
"887",2017,"Sex Roles","Promoting Theory-Based Perspectives in Sexual Double Standard Research","The sexual double standard (SDS) has been a focus of research for several decades. Numerous anecdotal accounts of the double standard exist, detailing its consequences and impact on women’s, as well as men’s, sexual behavior and identities. Empirical research, however, has yet to completely corroborate the degree to which the double standard pervades everyday life. The disparity between anecdotal accounts and empirical evidence related to the SDS may be the result of the partially atheoretical approach with which the SDS has traditionally been examined. The goal of the present paper is to encourage researchers to take a more theory-oriented approach to understanding the double standard. Our goal is not to provide another comprehensive literature review or an argument for the “best” theory, but rather to promote theory-based perspectives in future SDS research. In the current paper, three theoretical perspectives—evolutionary theory, social role theory, and cognitive social learning theory—and their relevance to the SDS are discussed. We discuss four hypotheses, one related to the core tenet of the SDS itself, and three related to moderating factors, including characteristics of evaluators (i.e., gender, gender roles beliefs, and sexual history), characteristics of targets (i.e., relationship type engaged in, sexual activities participated in, and power status), and social factors (i.e., cultural background, historical era, and socialization agents). Existing research is also interpreted in light of one or more of the theoretical perspectives in the hopes of guiding future research. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","2-s2.0-84984891541","United States"

Using data from a large representative German household panel, we investigate to what extent personality traits, human capital, and the employment history influence the start-up decision and can explain the gender gap in entrepreneurship. Applying a decomposition analysis, we observe that the higher risk aversion among women explains a large share of the entrepreneurial gender gap. We also find an education effect contributing to the gender difference. In contrast, the Big Five model and the current employment state have effects in the opposite direction, meaning that the gender gap in entrepreneurial entry would be even larger if women had the same scores and the same employment status as men. © The Author 2014.","2-s2.0-84941619417","Germany"
"889",2015,"Gender, Place and Culture","Embodying Islam and laïcité: young French Muslim women at work","In this article, I consider how the racialisation of Muslim identities in the French context affects the education and employment trajectories of six young French Muslim women with post-secondary education, living and working in Paris. I call attention to the pernicious effects of the intersection of three sets of governing discourses: laïcité, post-feminism and neoliberalism. These discourses obscure the way state-endorsed racialisation intersects with class and gender relations to erect barriers to Muslim women's employment opportunities. I examine the complex discursive and performative work Muslim women engage in, to inhabit, reproduce, reject or contest various interpretations of pious feminine Muslim and of French secular republican subjecthood. Work sites become important places where both pious and laïque subjectivities are often simultaneously produced and negotiated through performance and corporeality. In this way, the women's narratives challenge the discursive construction of the incompatibility of pious and secular subjectivities. Participants disrupted their racialisation as oppressed women who embody Muslimness by emphasising their individual and conscious choice to practise their religion. Yet, in doing so, and in the light of the challenges finding work for those wearing the headscarf, they were inadvertently rendered the agents of the discriminatory treatment that disadvantaged them in the labour market. The rational, free-choosing, neoliberal ‘self’ that they construct must then take individual responsibility for the negative consequences on their lives of broader collective racialising discourses. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84932192918","Singapore"

The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences on quality of life and functional impairment of outpatients with depression after acute phase treatment. Methods 1503 depression outpatients were recruited from eleven hospitals in China. Subjects were evaluated with sociodemographic characteristics, history and self-report instruments, related to severity of symptoms, function and quality of life. All data were analyzed to determine the gender differences. Results Men had a younger age at onset and the first onset age, higher education compared to women in total patients and with or without residual symptoms group. Using regression analysis, it was found that gender was significantly statistically related to severity scores of SDS and had no correlation with Q-LES-Q-SF total scores. In the residual symptoms group, greater functional impairment was noted by men in the area of work and social life. Significant gender differences of mood, work and sexual life in quality of life were observed. Limitations This is a cross-sectional study of depressed outpatients and duration of acute phase treatment may not an adequate time to measure changes. Conclusions Depression appears to affect men more seriously than women after acute phase treatment. Men had a younger age at onset and the first onset age, higher education, more functional impairment and lower satisfaction of quality of life in mood, work and sexual life.

Scholars have focused largely on the way in which Properzia's description aligns with derogatory assumptions about female nature in early modern Italy. While this is a defining characteristic of Properzia's vita, my paper explores alternative and potentially positive aspects of the text, by considering Vasari's attempts to integrate Properzia into the broader enterprise of the Lives and, more generally, art historical discourse of the time. I will argue that Vasari's approach invites a polemical response connected to these wider issues by setting up a paradoxical relationship between Properzia's archetypal female body and the manual movement required of it to sculpt. In contrasting notions of the feminine and the masculine, the noble body and the ignoble body, the intellectual and the manual, Properzia's vita can be connected specifically to the paragone (comparison) between painting and sculpture and also to questions relating to the status of the artist. In such a way the female artist is seen to take on an emblematic and instructive role within the text. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..","2-s2.0-84859115160","Australia"

Drawing from both the broader, tactical gender geopolitics of the Catholic Church and the embodied experiences of Catholic faithful in Latin America, the paper argues that the concept of cultural reanimation fails to capture the skilful way in which the Holy See asserts a gender theology that transcends the individual faithful body, through to the body of humanity.

The first section provides a rationale for linking the embodied intimate labor of sex workers and surrogate mothers to more traditional caregiving among nannies, nurses and eldercare aids. Through an intersectional optic on power and domination in care workers’ everyday lives, we highlight the ways in which love’s labor is lost and devalued in the sphere of the home as workplace, the family and community as employer, the state as labor recruiter, and the labor market as a site of ethnic boundaries and exclusions. Distinguishing different types of care and its institutional and geographic location matters in explaining current care in transition. Care work, in many domains, has become appropriated by markets. We consider how political, institutional, and cultural factors have shaped, and are reshaping, the ideas and norms of care in the context of transnational care worker migration. Too often, studies of gendered care migration fail to account for the differential impacts of state migration and care policies for women across class and social status within single country contexts. Care workers are beginning to challenge new forms of commodified care work.

"897",2014,"Research Papers in Education","Ethnicity, gender, social class and achievement gaps at age 16: Intersectionality and 'getting it' for the white working class","Perhaps the most prevailing inequalities in educational achievement in England are those associated with socio-economic status (SES), ethnicity and gender. However, little research has sought to compare the relative size of these gaps or to explore interactions between these factors. This paper analyses the educational achievement at age 11, 14 and 16 of over 15,000 students from the nationally representative longitudinal study of young people in England. At age 16, the achievement gap associated with social class was twice as large as the biggest ethnic gap and six times as large as the gender gap. However, the results indicate that ethnicity, gender and SES do not combine in a simple additive fashion; rather, there are substantial interactions particularly between ethnicity and SES and between ethnicity and gender. At age 16 among low SES students, all ethnic minority groups achieve significantly better than White British students (except Black Caribbean boys who do not differ from White British boys), but at high SES only Indian students outperform White British students. A similar pattern of results was apparent in terms of progress age 11-16, with White British low SES students and Black Caribbean boys (particularly the more able) making the least progress. Parents' educational aspirations for their child and students' own educational aspirations, academic self-concept, frequency of completing homework, truancy and exclusion could account for the minority ethnic advantage at low SES, but conditioning on such factors simultaneously indicates substantial ethnic underachievement at average and high SES. Accounts of educational achievement framed exclusively in terms of social class, ethnicity or gender are insufficient, and the results challenge educational researchers to develop more nuanced accounts of educational success or failure. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84893838687","United Kingdom"

Ya&#239;, Paulin Hountondji, Prosper Laleye and, more recently, by Ngoma-Binda. The article argues that if this debate is to be resurrected in the present, it must be done so by reconstructing African philosophy as social research and as an exploration of the possibilities inscribed within African reality. If African philosophy wants to have something relevant to say about contemporary social problems and contribute to the opening up of new futures, it must be built on social practices through which people may express their hopes and suffering as well as engage in re-imagining the future. What is required is an authenticity of philosophical practice in the struggle for emancipatory democracy and social justice. This is especially true where philosophy is said to be meaningful only when it is understood as a practice in a given context that it shapes at the same time as it is shaped by it. Thus, to reconstruct African philosophy is to revitalize it through contact with everyday life where the subject encounters his or her history.

"903",2017,"Biology of Sex Differences","The effects of 17 alpha-estradiol to inhibit inflammation in vitro","Background: 17 Alpha-estradiol (17 a-E2) is a natural, non-feminizing stereoisomer of 17 beta-estradiol (17 ß-E2). Whereas much is known about the physiological effects of 17 ß-E2, much less is known about 17 a-E2. For example, 17 ß-E2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects in neurons and adipocytes through binding and activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ERa); however, if 17 a-E2 has similar effects on inflammation is currently unknown. Methods: To begin to address this, we analyzed the ability of 17 a-E2 and 17 ß-E2 to suppress lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in vitro using embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF) from wild type and total body ERa (ERKO) male and female mice. Additionally, we further probed if there were sex differences with respect to the effects of E2s using primary pre-adipocyte cells from C57BL/6J male and female mice. Also, we probed mechanistically the effects of E2s in fully differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Results: Both E2s decreased LPS-induced markers of inflammation Tnf-a and Il-6, and increased the anti-inflammatory markers Il-4 and IL-6 receptor (Il-6ra) in MEF cells. To begin to understand the mechanisms by which both E2's mediate their anti-inflammatory effects, we probed the role of ERa using two methods. First, we used MEF cells from ERKO mice and found reductions in ERa diminished the ability of 17 a-E2 to suppress Tnf-a in female but not in male cells, demonstrating a sexual dimorphism in regard to the role of ERa to mediate 17 a-E2's effects. Second, we selectively reduced the expression of ERa in 3T3-L1 cells using siRNA and found reductions in ERa diminished the ability of both E2s to suppress Tnf-a and Il-6 expression. Lastly, to determine the mechanisms by which E2s reduce inflammation, we explored the role of NF<U+03BA>B-p65 and found both E2s decreased NF<U+03BA>B-p65 expression. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that 17 a-E2, as well as 17 ß-E2, suppresses inflammation through their effects on ERa and NF<U+03BA>B-p65. © 2017 The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85028927598","United States"
"904",2011,"Administrative Science Quarterly","Who Takes the Floor and Why: Gender, Power, and Volubility in Organizations","Although past research has noted the importance of both power and gender for understanding volubility-the total amount of time spent talking-in organizations, to date, identifying the unique contributions of power and gender to volubility has been somewhat elusive. Using both naturalistic data sets and experiments, the present studies indicate that while power has a strong, positive effect on volubility for men, no such effect exists for women. Study 1 uses archival data to examine the relationship between the relative power of United States senators and their talking behavior on the Senate floor. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between power and volubility for male senators, but a non-significant relationship for female senators. Study 2 replicates this effect in an experimental setting by priming the concept of power and shows that though men primed with power talk more, women show no effect of power on volubility. Mediation analyses indicate that this difference is explained by women's concern that being highly voluble will result in negative consequences (i.e., backlash). Study 3 shows that powerful women are in fact correct in assuming that they will incur backlash as a result of talking more than others-an effect that is observed among both male and female perceivers. Implications for the literatures on volubility, power, and previous studies of backlash are discussed. © The Author(s) 2011.","2-s2.0-84862495910","United States"

A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 cohort considered 2,552 youth aged 12 or 13 in the first survey wave. Comparison of girls and boys revealed, as expected, boys had higher levels of risk factors: early delinquency, gang involvement, and hopelessness. Girls were higher in the protective factors, parental monitoring, and school and religious ties; but boys were higher in parental support and work involvement. Negative binomial regression showed that gang exposure and hopelessness explained assaults, regardless of gender. For girls, early runaway behavior and work activity were positively, and parental monitoring was negatively, related to assaults. Unexpectedly, boys with high parental support were more assaultive than others.

This study addresses this need by considering the critical case of the protracted conflict over the Nagorny Karabakh region in the South Caucasus. Despite the 1994 ceasefire, no satisfactory settlement for all the parties involved in the conflict has yet been reached. In fact, since the four-day war in April 2016, the situation has become even more tense, with an increased risk of renewed hostilities. This article uses empirical research with women in Nagorny Karabakh to examine the impact of this protracted conflict through an analysis of emotions in their everyday lives. It argues that fear, grief and trauma not only affect individual women but also create a collective identity amongst them that is defined by compliance with the heightened militarization of society in this region. In this way, this study shows that emotions feed into the persistence of patriarchal relations.

Drawing on interviews and participant observations with white Swedish migrant women, the article argues that researchers need to turn the problems, fears and feelings of being uncomfortable into important data, in order to study privileged groups of women. © The Author(s) 2018.","2-s2.0-85044528520","Sweden"

"913",2017,"Stress and Health","Gender Differences in Perceptions of Resources and Turnover Intentions of Work-Linked Couples in Masculine Occupations","Employees in work-linked marriages have spouses that share the same family and the same workplace and/or occupation. Whereas, in recent years, there has been increasingly more research on dual-career marriages (i.e. both spouses work, but not necessarily at the same workplace and/or occupation), there has been very little research on work-linked marriages. The current study focuses on work resources (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviour and job control) as key mediating processes that explain the effect of gender on turnover intentions among work-linked employees in masculine occupations (i.e. military). Investigating gender differences is important because, compared with men, women are more likely to be in work-linked marriages and to leave their jobs. Based on role theory and conservation of resource theory, we predicted that gender was related to turnover intentions, and this relationship would be mediated by key explanatory variables (i.e. family supportive supervisor behaviours, job control and psychological distress). Mediation analyses, conducted on a sample of men and women in work-linked marriages (n = 309), provide support for the hypothesized model. These findings offer guidance for understanding gender differences among work-linked employees in masculine occupations, and how these differences can affect important outcomes such as turnover intentions.

A survey questionnaire was administered to 202 Japanese and 212 Korean undergraduate students. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that the two personality traits of extraversion and openness exerted a significant positive effect on an individual's propensity to touch others, such as their fathers, mothers, and close same-sex and opposite-sex friends. Furthermore, the relative effects of culture, gender, and personality on the tendency to touch varied depending on the target person. For example, culture was the strongest factor influencing an individual's propensity to touch their parents, whereas extraversion most strongly influenced one's tendency to touch close same-sex or opposite-sex friends. Our results suggest that individuals with high extraversion and/or high openness are more likely to use touching behavior as an instrument for building social relationships with close same-sex or opposite-sex friends.","2-s2.0-85028321221","Japan"

Results showed that, compared to undisclosed youths, disclosed youths reported higher levels of acceptance from their mothers and fathers in childhood, and lower levels of rejection by fathers in childhood. Also, as compared to undisclosed youths, a smaller proportion of disclosed youths reported they had engaged in alcohol and drug consumption behaviors. Among disclosed youths, past and current parental acceptance and rejection accounted for unique variance of youths' current identity and psychological maladjustment, whereas current rejection of sexual orientation accounted for unique variance of current youths' alcohol and drug consumption.

In this vein the Zimbabwe National Gender Policy (ZNGP) (2000) requires all state universities to implement gender equity programmes through gender mainstreaming to ensure gender equity in the higher education system. Gender mainstreaming is aimed at establishing transformative processes and practices to benefit both women and men equally by systematically integrating policies and programmes addressing gender into all aspects of an organization's work. Thus, to mainstream gender is to move gender from the periphery to the centre focus of any activity. This paper reports on the qualitative component of an investigation of the implementation of gender policy programmes in student admissions in two selected Zimbabwe state universities. Data gathering was conducted through documentary analysis and interviews from expert informants to explore the effectiveness of gender equity in student admissions. Findings, through an appraisal of current gender policy implementation in student admissions, revealed yawning gaps between implementation obtaining in the institutions and ideal practice. The main recommendation of the study is the need for a new shift in policy program implementation, and the study outlined the main cardinal points of this new paradigm.","2-s2.0-84900408662","South Africa"

Co-authored by an historian and an anthropologist, Bewitching Zulu Women begins with an ethnographic description of an incident of umhayizo in 2000 and then brings together a variety of sources and perspectives on umhayizo including late-nineteenth- century evidence of umhayizo from missionary accounts of the use of love medicines; archival documents which reflect increasing African ambivalence about the use of love medicines; accounts and explanations of umhayizo by ethnographers, anthropologists and psychologists from the 1950s; and recent observations of and treatments for umhayizo in rural KwaZulu-Natal. We argue that it is important to pay attention to the specificities of the phenomenon of umhayizo so as to understand how it might be placed in the context of gender politics, including the gendered use of love medicines, and of the control of women's sexuality both in the past, and now, at a time when HIV/AIDS ravages this region. © 2012 Southern African Historical Society.","2-s2.0-84868010185","South Africa"

The processes of masculinity construction by an adolescent, Kev, who used a prejudicial expression to bring a pejorative 'small' story to a climax, are examined in detail. Although immediate interlocutor responses were subdued and subtle, an explicit delayed response is followed-up by a repositioning of Kev as an 'undesirable other,' to which Kev constructs another small story as a counter-response.

Behavioral regulation was assessed using a direct measure, the Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders task, which requires children to switch rules by responding in the opposite way to 4 different oral commands. Results demonstrated nonsignificant gender differences in behavioral regulation and academic skills but significant gender differences in classroom work-related skills and social skills, with higher scores for girls. Multilevel path modeling revealed that behavioral regulation predicted none of the preacademic skills and classroom behaviors after child age, gender, verbal intelligence, maternal education, and classroom nesting were controlled. However, there was an interaction effect of behavioral regulation and gender for early reading; the contribution of behavioral regulation to early reading was positive and stronger for boys. Practice or Policy: These results suggest that behavioral regulation is not an overall strong predictor of school readiness in South Korean children. Early educators need to support the development of behavioral regulation skills, especially for boys, as these skills may work as an important path to school readiness when children lack other classroom social strategies and resources. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2-s2.0-84877277147","South Korea"

Using data obtained from a recent large-scale survey conducted in 36 countries, we find that individuals who like situations in which they compete with others are more likely to have a preference for being self-employed (latent entrepreneurs) and are also more likely to take steps to start new businesses (nascent entrepreneurs). Moreover, our results suggest that women are less competitively inclined than men in almost all countries in our sample and are also less willing to take risks. The results of a decomposition analysis suggest that gender differences in competitiveness and risk taking contribute significantly to the gender gap in latent and nascent entrepreneurship.

Exploring intersecting notions of gender, work, age and leisure time among people with cognitive disabilities","This article explores intersecting notions of leisure among middle-aged people with intellectual disabilities in the setting of the Swedish welfare state. The participants are recipients of long-term disability services and have experienced the changing ideological frameworks of the welfare effort, which has recently focused on normalisation, inclusion and participation. Structured activities are arranged by disability services in order to normalise living conditions and provide recreation for disabled people. However, the range of activities is constrained by financial resources, by notions of gender and age and by an institutionalised emphasis on the work ethic - leading to constructions of leisure partly as 'time beside' where 'free time' activities should not interfere with the duties of the working week. The participants' limited resources and their lack of a strong voice limit their ability to demand their legal rights and leave many of them with 'too much time with too little to do'. Key Practitioner Message: {filled circle} A common idea of leisure is the relationship between social and physical activities, well-being and health; {filled circle} People with disabilities, regardless of age, engage in fewer leisure activities than the general population due to a lack of resources; {filled circle} Even with legal rights, the lack of a strong voice as well as institutional constraints limit their leisure opportunities. © 2014 International Journal of Social Welfare and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","2-s2.0-84930894329","Sweden"

According to this theory, men may differ from women in the way how they express and experience depression. Aims of the study: The aim of our study was, on the one hand to detect gender differences in depressive sympatology. On the other hand, we assessed the relationship between symptoms of male type depression and alexithymia. Methods: The sample of 655 participants (mean age: 22.51 years; SD=28) filled out the questionnaires via Internet. After answering some demographic questions, respondents filled out the shortened version of the Beck Depression Inventory, the Gotland Male Depression Scale and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Results: Women reported more masculine specific symptoms of depression than men. Women more frequently showed aggression, irritability and frustration. Measuring the correlation between alexithy-mia and depression revealed that the lack of depression is accompanied with lower level of alexithymia. Participants who reported only masculine specific symptoms - which are least likely responses to depression - showed high alexithymia rates. Conclusion: Due to the fact that women report significant amount of male-type symptoms of depression - which correlate with the difficulties in emotion regulation - analyzing the symptoms in both sexes is considered to be relevant.","2-s2.0-84939633811","Hungary"

This segmented labour market allows the constructed and intersectional character of doing gender in organizations to be examined, which in turn may also effect the ways in which such labour segmentation continues to develop. In 2014–2015, we administered a questionnaire to 119 haredi women working as computer programmers in assimilative and segregated organizations, and interviewed 42 of them as well as 16 of their managers. We describe the emergence of a dual pattern of employment with its benefits and disadvantages regarding pay, satisfaction, commitment and burnout. Findings are presented concerning the balancing of work and family as well as the professional/social conflict that is accentuated by working in an assimilative organization. Our findings show how the intersection of work, religiosity, class and gender is central to women's labour trajectories and identities, highlighting both the boundaries of gendered arrangements and their negotiability.

Levels of schooling in 1975 were universally low for children 7-17 years. Large increases in schooling achievements occurred between 1975 and 2002. By 2002, schooling levels were comparable for younger boys and girls (7-12 years, N = 3,525) and favored older boys compared to older girls (13-17 years, N = 2,440) by about 0.5 grades. The associations of household standard of living and maternal schooling with schooling among girls diminished over time and became more comparable with these associations among boys, and the associations of household standard of living with schooling among older boys declined and became more comparable with these associations among girls. Thus, as increased social investments reduce the costs of schooling or increase the supply and quality of schooling to families, the magnitudes of the associations between parental resources and children's schooling decline and become more gender equitable at all ages. However, our results show that older boys may benefit more than older girls from social investments in schooling. These changes suggest potential needs to monitor gender gaps in schooling retention among older children, to insure gender equitable access to social investments in schooling, and to encourage parents to invest in schooling as joint measures to achieve greater schooling achievements of girls and boys. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","2-s2.0-84880624702","United States"

"942",2014,"European Journal of Women's Studies","Learning racism in the absence of 'race'","How do students learn about racism in the absence of 'race' as an explanatory concept for current social divisions? This article traces conceptual and affective negotiations of 'race' and racism in a Norwegian middle school classroom. Conceptual confusion about 'race', racism and lines of inclusion and exclusion in the nation is rife in this educational setting, where the curricular focus is on questions of immigration and integration. Treating 'race' as a 'chameleon-like' concept that adapts to the cultural context and political situation, the analysis highlights the emotional investments and injuries that discussing race brings forward in the situation through a Kleinian psychoanalytic lens. Working through the affective as well as the conceptual aspects of the classroom's struggles with 'race' and racism, the article argues that racism is enacted in the classroom partly as an effect of the denial of 'race' as a current effect of racism. Furthermore, it suggests that the denial of 'race' as an explanatory concept veils racial binaries that are enacted through Norwegian ethnonationalism, and facilitates enactment of racist dynamics in education that is intended to prevent racism. © The Author(s) 2013.","2-s2.0-84893528381","Norway"

One indicator of a society's view on alcohol use may be the way it considers the relationship between women and alcoholic beverages, be it marked with moral stigma or with the relevance that women have in controlling the drinking behaviour of men. Europe has experienced substantial social changes in recent years including attitudinal and behavioural changes regarding alcohol use. This study discusses the use of alcohol in Northern and Southern Europe with an emphasis on women's alcohol use both historically and currently. Recent research on gender variations in alcohol use and its implications for treatment and prevention efforts in Europe is discussed.

Much less is known, however, about how news providers portray women politicians differently over time, either in tandem with developments in the political and media landscape — e.g., the presence, visibility, and role of women in politics — or to reflect changes in internal newsroom policies. Against this background, this study aims to compare and contrast the news coverage of female candidates in two successive general elections, using multiethnic Malaysia as its case. Samples of news articles from Malaysiakini — one of Malaysia’s major independent online newspapers — were collected for the election periods of 2008 and 2013 and subjected to qualitative content analysis, with a focus on headlines. Findings suggest that the more recent reporting of women candidates helps position women as competent professionals compared with the more gendered portrayals five years before. At the same time, there is a trend away from descriptive to interpretive journalism, putting the many challenges that Malaysian women face as candidates in a wider societal and international context. The implications of the study are that also in Malaysia, individual newspapers can change over time, revise their gender stereotypes and overall play a stronger role in enhancing women’s electoral viability. © 2018, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

"945",2008,"Indian Journal of Gender Studies","Male hierarchies and gender-balanced boards","The aim of the present study is to examine whether the established fact that men by far outnumber women in leading positions is an inherent unintentional characteristic of a hierarchy where appointments happen one by one on an individual basis, as opposed to boards where the members are appointed as a group. The sample consists of those appointed to the hierarchies as well as the boards of 36 state universities in Sweden. The main finding is that significantly more men are appointed in hierarchies than to group-composed boards. When the gendered distribution of those in leading positions becomes fully apparent, the last and final position in the hierarchy is significantly more often given to a woman. However, these women are much older than their male counterparts, a fact that makes it harder for them to reach the final step of the ladder. The article concludes with a discussion of whether the higher probability of appointing a woman as vice-president when both chair and president are men is a fair acknowledgement of an unfair gender distribution, or if there are other possible explanations.","2-s2.0-58149506209","Sweden"

In Switzerland, the tangible investment of men is generally characterized, in comparison to women, by a lesser involvement in domestic and familial tasks, which is reduced further following the birth of a child. Objectives: Using this statement as our starting point, this article explores the relationship between gender ideology and the investment of men and fathers in this area. Methodology: Using multi-variate statistics models, our analysis attempts to determine whether attitudes to family life and equality have an influence on the domestic and familial involvement of men. We conducted over 25,000 telephone interviews between 2000 and 2011 as a part of the Swiss Household Panel (SHP). Results: Our results showed four types of masculinity. The “Professional Man” essentially builds his masculinity through their professional implication in the employment and financial aspects of the household. The “Orthodox Man” remains the main financial provider though they do not eschew domestic tasks. Regardless, they tend to take care of tasks that are socially defined as being masculine. The “Traditional Manager” has a similar profile though they only take charge of tasks that are negotiable such as the administrative aspects of the home. The “Inclusive Man” shares more time between paid and unpaid work with their partner. Conclusions: These different profiles are less explained by the practical application of a gender ideology than by institutional and pragmatic factors such as economic and human capital and the disposition of partners. Contributions: By offering a typology for involvement in unpaid work for Swiss men and by empirically examining several explanations for the stated differences, this article provides an original contribution to the understanding of masculinity in a familial context.","2-s2.0-85041956486","Germany"
"950",2009,"Perspectives on European Politics and Society","Constituting and reconstituting the gender order in Europe","The existence of a European gender order is intrinsically connected with the creation and development of the European Union. The construction of this order-a combination of values, laws and practices seeking to give effect to gender equality-is contested at both supranational and nation-state levels. This article takes Ostner and Lewis' 'two needles eyes' thesis to discuss the European and national constraints on the adoption of and compliance with the directives that constitute the 'hard law' of this transnational gender order. It examines the evolution of the legal order on gender equality, noting that the Amsterdam Treaty ushered in a more expansive context for the application of gender norms and practices. It also explores the extent to which member states have been open to the Europeanization of national gender regimes. It finds that challenges continue to exist at European and domestic levels to the extension, and implementation, of laws, policies and practices facilitating gender equality. It also finds, though, that the pattern of compliance in the Eastern enlargement countries is not out of step with the implementation patterns in older member states, even though social conditions are very different. In general, the study concludes that although the context for the construction of a gender order in Europe has changed, supranational and national challenges to gender equality persist.","2-s2.0-67949123030","United Kingdom"

During the past two decades, the number of users has increased rapidly and online dating today forms a key context for negotiating romantic relations. Thus, online dating practices are rich fields for investigating the workings of desire. Based on audiovisual recordings of two Danish female friends engaging in online dating activities, this article demonstrates how participants, through joint stance-taking, co-construct shared desire and adjust individually-produced desire to create homosocial affiliation. Hence, in this case, heterosexual desire construction is a collaborative undertaking generated through homosocial bonding. The performed desire carries a strong physical focus, partly produced by the participants' attention to bodily detail and partly through the dating site's visual design. The article concludes by arguing for the incorporation of attention to homosocial aspects in research into heterosexual desire. © 2015, equinox publishing.","2-s2.0-84949235978","Denmark"

Bivariate zero-order correlations indicated that help-seeking attitudes was negatively associated with self-stigma of seeking help (r = -.55) and positively associated with religious commitment (r =.14), and self-stigma was not significantly associated with religious commitment. Men reported more negative attitudes than women (<U+0394>M = -.18). Furthermore, multiple regression results revealed a three-way interaction such that the relationship between gender and help-seeking attitudes was moderated by both self-stigma and religious commitment. Specifically, men with high religious commitment and high self-stigma endorsed the most negative help-seeking attitudes, suggesting that religious men’s help-seeking attitudes may be particularly susceptible to the influence of self-stigma.

"955",2010,"Cambridge Review of International Affairs","Mainstreaming gender in refugee protection","The issues of gender-related persecution and violence against women have been put onto the international agenda, largely thanks to lobbying by feminist NGOs and transnational networks. There is a question, however, of how successfully this agenda-setting has translated into effective policy-making and policies that will increase the protection of women who are victims of gender-related persecution. One of the problems with policies to support women refugees and asylum seekers lies in a failure of transmission of the goals of gender sensitivity through all the various bureaux and representatives of a large bureaucratic organization such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). For nearly twenty years, since the early 1990s, theUNHCR has identified 'refugee women' as a policy priority, and yet, despite this prioritization of concerns about women refugees and gender issues in the asylumand refugee process, it could be argued that little progress has been made in implementation of policies on refugee women. This article will examine the way in which the concept of gender has been adopted within theUNHCR and the processes that have been put in place to mainstream gender within refugee protection activities. How far has mainstreaming managed to move policies to protect women beyond a mere focus on 'vulnerable' groups, and to integrate a gendered understanding of the global processes that produce refugees, and of the protection needs of these refugees? © 2010 Centre of International Studies.","2-s2.0-79959995327","France"
"956",2018,"Gender and Society","Equality on His Terms: Doing and Undoing Gender through Men’s Discussion Groups","Efforts to promote gender equality often encourage changes to interpersonal interactions as a way of undermining gender hierarchy. Such programs are premised on the idea that the gender system can be “undone” when individuals behave in ways that challenge prevailing gender norms. However, scholars know little about whether and under what conditions real changes to the gender system can result from changed behaviors. We use the context of a gender sensitization program in the Democratic Republic of Congo to examine prospects for transformative change at the interactional level of the gender system. Over nine months, we observed significant changes in men’s quotidian practices. Further, we identified a new commitment among many men to a more equal division of household labor. However, participants consistently undermined the transformative potential of these behavioral changes through their dedication to maintaining control over the objective, process, and meaning of change, resisting conceptions of equality that challenged the gender system. Because quotidian changes left gender hierarchy intact, they appear unlikely to destabilize the logics that legitimate women’s subordination. © 2018, 2018 by The Author(s).","2-s2.0-85048956262","United Kingdom"

Beyond simply depicting ascetics as extraordinary human beings, these complexly gendered portraits more importantly served as expressions of an argument Theodoret advanced elsewhere: that men and women shared a common human nature. Based on these observations, the article then offers an interpretation of the two bodily examinations performed upon Theodoret's most influential character, Simeon the Stylite, namely that these scenes were carefully narrated to suggest that they were examinations of a female body. In conclusion, I argue scholars should consider the peculiar uses of gender in each ancient representation of early Christian asceticism, rather than assume early Christian texts only associated masculinity with excellence in ascetic practice. © 2015 Johns Hopkins University Press.","2-s2.0-84948156533","United States"

Objective: To explore gender differences in psycho-social stressors, in the level and prevalence of stress, and its potential consequences. Methods: Cross-sectional study of 4527 people using a national representative sample obtained in 2006 (Hungarostudy 2006). Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, frequency) were used to explore the prevalence and level of stressors and their potential consequences. Gender differences in the level and prevalence of stress and health outcomes were measured using independent sample t-tests and chi-square tests, respectively. Results: Women experienced significantly higher level of stressors compared to men and reported significantly higher level of work-family conflict, marital stress, social stress, overcommitment, and significantly lower level of work control than men. Upon exploring the potential consequences of stress, women reported significantly lower level of general well-being but higher level of life meaning than men. Men reported significantly higher level of hostility compared to women. Conclusions: Our results suggest that gender differences in psycho-social well-being may be attributed to gender-specific differences in stressors and consequent stress. These results may be useful for the development of organizational policies, which aim at reducing the high stress levels and work-family conflict among women and may therefore improve their quality of life. ©2010 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.","2-s2.0-78651433867","Hungary"

Aim: To assess undergraduate students' patient-centred attitudes at various stages of education and to explore possible associations between attitudes and age, gender and work experience in health care. Methods: In autumn 2005, medical students in Gothenburg (n 797) were asked to answer Patient-Practitioner Orientation Scale (PPOS), a validated instrument exploring attitudes towards the doctor-patient relationship. Data including gender, age, current term and students' work experience in health care were collected. Results: Of 797 students 600 (75) answered the questionnaire. No decrease of students' PPOS score across the curriculum was observed. PPOS scores from female students were higher compared to males (p < 0.0001) and female scores were significantly higher in the later terms compared with earlier (p 0.0011). Female students had more experience from working in health care (p 0.0023). Extended work experience was associated with higher PPOS only among females (p 0.0031). Conclusion: No decline of students' patient-centred attitudes may indicate an ongoing shift. Gender differences in patient-centred attitudes were reproduced.

It argues that although Frith escapes the violation of being disrobed and dissected by contemporary readers seeking the naked truth beneath her sartorial hermaphroditism, she does so by erasing her body from her text. The essay demonstrates how the self-repressed female form surfaces to challenge Frith's assumption that cross-gendering can only be achieved by severing gender identity from corporeality. Ultimately it shows how female same sex desire and the female body's maternal potential both threaten and found Frith's fragmented self, and it suggests that Frith's refusal to acknowledge her debt to female literary traditions prevents her from radically reinscribing her body to accord with her transgendered identity and sexuality. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.""","2-s2.0-79959523127","United States"

The motivating question is whether investments in education provide sufficient resources to escape the risk of poverty in the low-income sector or if changes in household characteristics are more important determinants of one's living standard. Changes in household characteristics are defined in terms of partners' entry into and exit from households and partners' different labour market profiles. The analysis focuses on households in the low-income sector in Germany, a population that is at high risk of poverty in a social welfare state that is expected to mitigate the effects of changes in family formation independent of gender. Findings from panel regression analysis demonstrate that women, in contrast to men, benefit economically as much as or more from investing in traditional family formations than in their own labour market position.

"970",2015,"Australian Feminist Studies","Theorising The Everyday","Abstract: This article reflects on the gender politics integral to theories and cultural histories of the everyday in the contemporary Humanities and (to a lesser extent) Social Sciences. Since the 1990s feminist scholars have observed the gender bias integral to many canonical twentieth-century theories of the everyday. In spite of these observations, I suggest that much everyday life theory and recent studies that map a cultural and intellectual history of the everyday continue to reflect this gender bias. I suggest that one possible reason for this is women’s historical exclusion from the realm of theoretical discourse broadly conceived, and propose that in order to trace alternative critiques and histories of the everyday feminist scholars need to look to alternative modes of cultural and discursive production—for example, literature, the essay and art—through which to trace implicit and explicit analyses of the everyday by women. The second part of the article turns to the work of the twentieth-century photographer Dorothea Lange as a case in point. While Lange’s work has never been discussed in studies of the everyday, the concept underpins her practice and her work offers some suggestive points of comparison to approaches to the everyday both in Lange’s time and in contemporary theory. Focusing on her little-known essays ‘Documentary Photography’ and ‘Photographing the Familiar’ and some of her images of rural California during the Depression years, I examine her account of the role of the ‘familiar’ and everyday to the social, aesthetic and ethical potential of documentary photography as a medium at the time. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84938382918","Australia"

These two goals are distinguished as gender parity goals [achieving equal participation of girls and boys in all forms of education based on their proportion in the relevant age-groups in the population] and gender equality goals [ensuring educational equality between boys and girls]. In turn these have been characterised as quantitative/numerical and qualitative goals respectively. In order to consider progress towards both types of goal, both quantitative and qualitative assessments need to be made of the nature of progress towards gender equality. Achieving gender parity is just one step towards gender equality in and through education. An education system with equal numbers of boys and girls participating, who may progress evenly through the system, may not in fact be based on gender equality. Following Wilson (Human Rights: Promoting gender equality in and through education. Background paper for EFA GMR 2003/4, 2003) a consideration of gender equality in education therefore needs to be understood as the right to education [access and participation], as well as rights within education [gender-aware educational environments, processes, and outcomes], and rights through education [meaningful education outcomes that link education equality with wider processes of gender justice]. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Using structural equation modeling, we found an indirect effect of participant gender, and both direct and indirect effects of stalking myth acceptance and gender role stereotyping on guilt ratings. Men and participants who endorsed more traditional gender role stereotypes were associated with adherence to stalking myth acceptance beliefs. Endorsement of particular stalking myth acceptance beliefs offers a partial explanation for why women and men differed on perceptions of the defendant's intent to cause danger and the victim's perceived fear and distress. Results provide insight into the efficacy of current anti-stalking legislation that relies on a juror's capacity to evaluate an ‘objective’ interpretation (i.e., ‘reasonable person’) standard of fear for intimate partner stalking. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84922230638","United States"

This article follows on from this research by assessing the degree of gender-neutrality of the French pension reforms of 1993 and 2003. To this end, the entitlements of the 1965-1974 cohorts were projected using the Destinie dynamic microsimulation model for three different scenarios: before the 1993 reform; between the 1993 and 2003 reforms; and after the 2003 reform. We demonstrate that although the provisions are gender-neutral, these reforms appear to have a more negative impact on women's pension entitlements than on those of men. Without the reforms and assuming a continuation of current labour force participation trends, men of the 1965-74 cohorts will receive a mean pension that is 47% higher than that of women. With the 1993 reform, the ratio is 1.54, and with that of 2003, it is 1.59.","2-s2.0-33847773584","France"
"975",2013,"European Journal of Women's Studies","Gender, Basque nationalism and women's associations: The case of Lanbroa","Since the beginning of the twentieth century in the Spanish Basque Country, Basque nationalism has served as a unifying movement that encouraged women to participate in women's associations. Women's associations offered a metaspace in which public and private spheres overlap, where, women began to reconstruct meanings of nationalism and gender relations in distinct ways. As a result, the particular foci of these associations reflected each individual association's specific understanding of gender relations and their relations to different interpretations of Basque nationalism. This historical tradition has continued into the twenty-first century as women's associations that are structured by distinct systems of gender relations provide a number of social services and educational services to promote gender equality. Through the examination of the metaspace of the women's association Lanbroa, this article explores the ways in which the women's movement and feminism have influenced the functioning of this association and the ways in which association members contest traditional Basque gender relations. © The Author(s) 2013.","2-s2.0-84872578781","United States"
"976",2008,"Drug and Alcohol Dependence","Evidence for a closing gender gap in alcohol use, abuse, and dependence in the United States population","Background: Descriptively, male-female differences in alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders appear to have decreased in birth cohorts reaching adulthood since the 1970s compared to earlier birth cohorts. However, such birth cohort effects on gender differences have never been statistically tested in nationally representative data. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that gender differences in alcohol consumption, abuse, and dependence are decreasing over time. Methods: Face-to-face survey conducted in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions among those aged <90 (N = 42,693). Birth cohort was divided into four categories: 1913-1932, 1933-1949, 1950-1967, 1968-1984. Outcomes included lifetime largest drinks, frequent binge drinking, DSM-IV defined alcohol abuse, and alcohol dependence, measured with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule (AUDADIS-IV). Findings: Birth cohort and gender interacted significantly in predicting lifetime largest drinks (F = 27.6, [d.f. = 3], p < 0.0001), frequent binge drinking (F = 40.0, [d.f. = 3], p < 0.0001), alcohol abuse (F = 62.0, [d.f. = 3], p < 0.0001) and alcohol dependence (F = 15.3, [d.f. = 3], p < 0.0001). Cohort-specific ORs indicated monotonic decreases in the gender ratio in more recent birth cohorts for all outcomes. Conclusion: These results suggest that gender differences in the prevalence of all four outcomes are decreasing in younger age cohorts. While these changes are consistent with a cohort effect, the possibility of age and period effects cannot be ruled out but suggest important avenues for more specific hypothesis testing. Further, women in younger cohorts may be in need of new targeted prevention and intervention efforts. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.","2-s2.0-37049033082","United States"

For the sake of optimizing such treatment, the present study seeks to distinguish specific post-rape symptoms from those observed following other forms of trauma, particularly in respect to self-blame and related PTSD. Given typical societal victim-blaming following rape, self-blame is expected to be considerably more extreme among survivors of rape than in other victims, and predictive of relatively elevated post-trauma symptoms.

The paper discusses postcolonial feminist key concepts, namely representation, subalternity, and reflexivity and the challenges scholars face when deploying these concepts in fieldwork settings. The paper then outlines the implications of these concepts for feminist praxis related to international management theory, research, and writing as well as entrepreneurship programs. Design/methodology/approach - This paper discusses the experiences of the author in conducting fieldwork on Turkish high-technology entrepreneurs in the USA and Turkey by focusing explicitly on the challenges and complexities postcolonial feminist frameworks bring to ethnography and auto-ethnography. Findings - The paper suggests that conducting fieldwork guided by postcolonial feminist frameworks faces challenges related to representation inclusive of the author and the participants in the study. It offers subalternity as a relational understanding of subjects in contrast to comparative approaches to the study of business people. The paper also discusses how positionality impacts reflexivity through gender, ethnicity, and class relations.

"980",2014,"Career Development International","The gender gap in pre-career salary expectations: A test of five explanations","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the gender gap in pre-career salary expectations. Five major explanations are tested to explain the gap, as well as understand the relative contribution of each explanation. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 452 post-secondary students from Canada. Findings – Young women had lower initial and peak salary expectations than their male counterparts. The gap in peak salary could be explained by initial salary expectations, beta values, the interaction between beta values and gender, and estimations of the value of the labor market. Men and women in this study expected to earn a considerably larger peak salary than they expected for others. Research limitations/implications – Cross-sectional data cannot infer causality, and the Canadian sample may not be generalizable to other countries given that an economic downturn occurred at time of data collection. Research should continue to investigate how individuals establish initial salary expectations, while also testing more dynamic models given the interaction effect found in terms of gender and work values in explaining salary expectations. Practical implications – The majority of the gender gap in peak salary expectations can be explained by what men and women expect to earn immediately after graduation. Further, women and men have different perceptions of the value they attribute to the labor market and what might be a fair wage, especially when considering beta work values. Social implications – The data suggests that the gender-wage gap is likely to continue and that both young men and women would benefit from greater education and information with respect to the labor market and what they can reasonably expect to earn, not just initially, but from a long-term perspective. Originality/value – This study is the first to simultaneously investigate five theoretical explanations for the gender gap in pre-career expectations. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2-s2.0-84926377703","Canada"

It raises questions about claims by Revisionist Feminist Scholars that official state socialist women’s organizations were ‘agents’ on behalf of women, or women’s movements, perhaps feminist, and not ‘transmission belts’ of communist parties. State socialist policies are described as ‘friendly towards women’ and ‘pro-women’. In contrast, the author claims that these organizations both were and were not agents on behalf of women, and also prevented women’s agency. Meaningful women’s agency is not actually shown to occur intermittently throughout their history, but in two contexts – before 1955 or in moments of political rupture. Scholars do not distinguish the who, when, and what – Who could be agents? When could they be agents? And what kind of agents could they be? State policies, the author claims, were also at one and the same time ‘friendly’ and ‘unfriendly’ towards women, sometimes harming women. The author explores why this research is happening now, discussing research on Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the Democratic Women’s Organization of Germany (DFD), the Democratic Association of Hungarian Women (MNDSZ), later renamed MNOT, the Romanian National Council of Women (CNF) and the Yugoslav Anti-Fascist Women’s Organization (AFZ). © The Author(s) 2014.","2-s2.0-84908664747","United States"

Finnish entrepreneurship education and the enterprising selves imagined by pupils","This article examines the spread of the neo-liberal educational policy in Finnish schools by considering entrepreneurship education. We examined the kinds of gendered and classed enterprising selves that were narrated in the Finnish writing competition Good Enterprise! written by pupils in the 9th grade of comprehensive school. In their narratives of enterprising selves, the pupils constructed the middle-class version of the self, where the person was not contingent upon external effects but an autonomous self-governing individual. Moreover, the possible selves of boys matched the culturally valued representations of the autonomous, risk-taking entrepreneurial individual more closely than the self-representations of girls did. However, it was especially the boys' narratives of modest entrepreneurship with the traditional virtues of the respectable citizen that were successful in the competition. This finding is in conflict with the educational policies of the European Union, which call for risk-taking abilities and competition as pre-conditions for achieving progress. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-77649098660","Finland"
"984",2016,"Feminist Media Studies","#Free_CeCe: the material convergence of social media activism","In 2011 CeCe McDonald, an African-American transgender woman, was charged with murder for killing her attacker during a racist and transphobic assault in Minneapolis. After McDonald’s arrest, local queer communities organized an astounding level of support. This article examines the CeCe Support Committee as a case study for effective grassroots organizing that is fueled by and increasingly reliant upon social media for advancing social justice. An ethnographic approach reveals how the success of the Committee’s social media activism largely depended on traditional activist strategies. Because the group’s activism was based on unpaid labor and supported by numerous physical protests, the use of social media platforms enabled the Support Committee to challenge news media’s racialized framing of McDonald’s gender non-conformity as deceiving and threatening and exposed the state-sanctioned violence enacted against her. Therefore, I contend that the transformative political potential of social media activism is only possible when sustained by coordinated, “on-the-ground” activism offline. Moreover, this case study illustrates that intersecting oppressions do not simply disappear in online activism, but that those oppressions—particularly the centrality of whiteness in organizing—continue to constrain the actual material achievements of social media activism. For the CeCe Support Committee the convergence of on- and offline activism resulted in a raised public consciousness about the disposability of transgender lives, turning a national spotlight on the violence transgender people face. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84959057148","United States"

It questions whether these discursive tools are useful for analyses of contemporary, male-focalized television, or whether they need updating.

Translation involves meaning-making, which consists of several simultaneous processes, including recuperation, hybridization, simplification and compartmentalization. The direction of the translation process is not linear, but resembles a spiral with ideas moving from global to local to global.

A British colony since the mid-nineteenth century, Hong Kong was returned to China in the 1997 handover to become a 'Special Administrative Region'.

For the white British, the opportunities to reconfigure discourses and subjectivities of whiteness are there, although the findings of this research reveals the unevenness of take-up. The paper draws on a broad feminist post-structuralist approach to reveal the ways in which four different British women migrants position themselves in the changing landscape. The approach shows important patterns of difference and diversity between the women in the performances of gendered Britishness and whiteness, and in the extent to which these are used to redefine or challenge the memory of relations established through imperialism.","2-s2.0-38549181632","United Kingdom"

Traditionally, what has literally and figuratively stitched masculinity and mexicanidad together has been the charro costume, in particular the pants and hat.

Yet implementation of these plans has been problematic, because even in the public sector working conditions are not suitable for female staff to operate efficiently. This paper suggests that a work environment which is sensitive to the practical and strategic needs of women is needed to sustain gender equality. Using primary data from a survey conducted by the first author with 300 educated female employees of 24 different public sector organizations it has been shown that very few women reach to the top management tiers in their organizations due to systematic disadvantages imposed by a male-oriented work environment. On a personal level, most of the female public servants were found to be having excessively hectic work routines given the burden of their domestic responsibilities. Multivariate regression analysis reveals that the education sector offers a more favorable work environment as compared to health and administrative sectors. A surprising finding is that a higher ratio of female to male employees will not automatically lead to an improvement in the work environment for women personnel, unless women themselves are gender sensitized. These results call for redesigning gender policies in public sector organizations such that women can contribute fully towards the attainment of organizational goals without having to compromise on their family welfare.","2-s2.0-79953142298","Pakistan"

Our results are somewhat surprising compared with earlier research: We find that noun phrase-internal agreement for the most part is rather stable. To the extent that we find attrition, it affects agreement in the noun phrase, but not the declension of the noun. We discuss whether this means that gender is lost and has been reduced to a pure declension class, or whether gender is retained. We argue that gender is actually retained in these heritage speakers. One argument for this is that the speakers who lack agreement in complex noun phrases, have agreement intact in simpler phrases. We have thus found that the complexity of the noun phrase is crucial for some speakers. However, among the heritage speakers we also find considerable inter-individual variation, and different speakers can have partly different systems. © 2015 Johannessen and Larsson.","2-s2.0-84954204851","Norway"

It compares the findings of the first stage of two studies, based on ad hoc questionnaires responded to by 136 women and 129 men. Results showed only subtle differences between the leadership styles deployed by the two groups. Both groups viewed organisations as social constructions; they preferred characteristics such as responsibility, ability to get on well with people, motivation capacity, communication and empathy, capacity to tackle difficult situations, and ethical issues. Consistent with this both groups identified similar training needs, which included the acquisition of abilities to deal with interpersonal conflicts and the construction of personal criteria to select the best strategy to face every situation. As no significant differences between male and female leaders were found, it is suggested that research into higher education organisations and their management training needs from a gender perspective should focus on the way both men and women managers tackle problems and situations. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","2-s2.0-84928706397","Spain"
