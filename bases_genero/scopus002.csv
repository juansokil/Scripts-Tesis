Critical theory and critical discourse analysis, supported by narrative analysis and visual analysis, offer a robust methodology to problematize the manner in which textually mediated discourses impact social policy reform for recruiting, retraining and retaining older workers. The results show that still in such an “age positive” social policy environment, negative stereotypes about older workers persist, threatening to constrain social change. An exemplary analysis of two texts, representative of those related to Australian government initiatives to reform access to work for older citizens, provides an accessible means of (re)evaluating if and how such policies are more inclusive of older workers. This paper contributes to an emerging trend in organization studies using a critical discourse analytic approach not only to written texts, but also to the less familiar visual narratives and stories. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Critical discourse analysis; Narratives; Older workers; Policy reform; Positioning theory; Recruitment; Small stories; Written and visual texts",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

This questioning demonstrates that the coherence and the intelligibility imposed by heteronormative codes need to be urgently reviewed in order to question the sociall order presented by the splitting gender in reproductive sex.

I look first at the dangers of reifying culture, apparent in the tendencies to plaster neat cultural icons like the Muslim woman over messy historical and political dynamics. Then, calling attention to the resonances of contemporary discourses on equality, freedom, and rights with earlier colonial and missionary rhetoric on Muslim women, I argue that we need to develop, instead, a serious appreciation of differences among women in the world - as products of different histories, expressions of different circumstances, and manifestations of differently structured desires. Further, I argue that rather than seeking to ""save"" others (with the superiority it implies and the violences it would entail) we might better think in terms of (1) working with them in situations that we recognize as always subject to historical transformation and (2) considering our own larger responsibilities to address the forms of global injustice that are powerful shapers of the worlds in which they find themselves.

The evidence considered of the everlasting gender discourses in Saudi Arabia includes examples from the girls' home economics textbook for Grades 7 and 8. This paper confirms that Saudi society is witnessing a growing acknowledgment of the undeniable Scriptural basis for women's participation in all aspects of public life and an accompanying dilution of the influence of the some conservative Ulama as enforcers of a narrow and literal interpretation of Islam. This paper also confirms that important institutional and policy changes are underway that are creating new educational and employment opportunities for women. The result is that the deeply entrenched gender issues that has for so long characterized the Saudi education system and society as a whole is being challenged by progressive Islamic principles and by a variety of institutional reforms, among other factors. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Islam; Muslim women; progress; Saudi Arabia; women; women's rights",,"Hamdan, A.; University of Western Ontario AlumniCanada",,,15692078,,,,"English","Hawwa",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871023680

A strong feeling of 'inseparation' emanates from what divides through unity, from the border as a wound uniting and separating both narrations and people.

These texts do not always present the perspective of the expectant parents on pregnancy; the perspective of the fetus on gestation in particular is prominent in the texts bearing Indic-Buddhist influences. This paper argues that over time the confluence of concepts and metaphors presented in these texts added up to an extremely negative attitude widely held toward the fetus and childbirth. This negativity in turn reinforced, and was reinforced by, the concepts and practices of filial piety that emerged in the centuries following the collapse of the Han dynasty, which were different from those that came before. It also profoundly transformed and enhanced the mother-child bond at the expense of that of the father and child. In particular, the salvational dimension of the mother-child relationship, introduced by Buddhism, made possible a women-centered interpretation of filial piety. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2012.","Childbirth; Chinese fetal development; Filial piety; Motherhood; Women's salvation",,"Choo, J.J.C.; Rutgers University-New, Brunswick, United States; email: jessey.choo@rutgers.edu",,,13876805,,,,"English","NAN NU",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874839758

The heterosexist nature of the sororities was attributed to the influence of conservative Christianity, the power wielded by socially conservative older members, and the construction of standards of femininity that exclude lesbians. However, all respondents noted that they knew or suspected that other sorority sisters were lesbians, but their acceptance in the organization was frequently premised on concealing their sexual orientation.

Though hierarchies of class, ethnicity, gender, and generation segment the ranks of DBC brotherhood and the church community writ large, church members invest in brotherhood as a social formation that they believe sidesteps the exclusions of mainstream religious institutions.

College health services typically offer sexual health resources, but the extent varies widely and these services may be under-utilized by students. Understanding how a diverse sample of students views college health resources is a critical step towards more effectively addressing students' sexual health needs. Seventy-eight students (mean age020.5) from five Minnesota colleges participated in ""go-along"" interviews in 2010. Colleges included both two- and fouryear institutions in metropolitan and non-metro locations, and the student sample was diverse. Participants led researchers around their campus physically and virtually to explore sexual health resources in that setting. Transcribed recordings were coded and organized into descriptive categories. Top resources identified by students included condom distribution programs (88.5 %), on-campus health clinics (80.8 %), off-campus clinics (75.6 %), and sexual health information (71.8 %). Important differences were noted between students at two- and four-year colleges. Students offered many reflections on positive and negative aspects of each resource and suggestions for making resources accessible, comfortable, and useful. Increased communication about available resources was a priority for students. College health service staff and administrators should consider the types of sexual health resources students are interested in, the qualities they value in these resources, and ways to make them available to students. Specific implications for expanding resources may differ in twovs. four-year colleges. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","College students; Health services; Qualitative methods; Sexual health; Young adults",,"Eisenberg, M.E.; Division of Adolescent Health and Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, 717 Delaware St. SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414, United States; email: eisen012@umn.edu",,,18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

Policy within New Zealand (NZ), as in many Western countries, often takes a particularly individualistic approach to reducing STI rates, but this has proved unsuccessful. This paper presents a thematic analysis of interview data from 32 key informants working in sexual health in NZ, talking about sexual health problems and solutions. Focusing typically on structural explanations, informants identified a large gap between 'best practice' and actual practice in NZ. They referred to the interaction between a lack of government prioritisation and a 'sexually conservative' culture in New Zealand as lying at the heart of this. Informants advocated for a long-term programme of government leadership and a cultural 'shift' in approaches to, and research on, sexual health. To do so, key informants consistently constructed an account of 'competing rationalities'-or the notion that policy makers, and those that work in the 'frontline' of sexual health are operating within two opposing paradigms, and that the 'culture of conservatism' they described was limiting dialogue between the two 'sides'. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Competing rationalities; Key informants; Sexually transmitted infections (STIs); Sociocultural factors; Thematic analysis",,"Terry, G.; Department of Psychology, University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand; email: g.terry@auckland.ac.nz",,,18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

Swedish experts argued that research should focus upon global sex markets and hegemonic masculinities, successfully advocating criminalizing clients and pimps, but not prostitutes. The article argues that both policies exemplify contrasting advanced liberal governmental techniques. In New Zealand, the critical methodology of attention to prostitute voices informed techniques of agency which sought to empower sex workers to manage their own health and human rights problems. In Sweden, the methodology of studying up informed advanced liberal authoritarian techniques which disciplined and punished sex buyers in the interests of their own freedom and in conformity with Swedish constructions of freedom.

Analysis of formal statements of policymakers and other actors engaged in this formative debate shows that abstinence advocates used the discursive mechanism of synecdoche to capture the terms of argumentation and advance their policy agenda. They viewed condoms as inappropriately granted ""permission slips"" for sexual activity and focused their argumentation on one aspect of HIV/ AIDS preventive measures, a plan to make condoms available to the city's high school students. Proponents of comprehensive HIV/AIDS education attempted to counter the condom synecdoche by reasserting the larger curriculum and falsifying the synecdoche's logical basis. This analysis illuminates the dynamics of New York City's HIV/AIDS education policy discourse, showing how it not only made the resolution of underlying value differences difficult but also reduced the effectiveness of HIV prevention and sex education policy making.

Drawing upon 19 semi-structured life-history interviews with women between 24 and 60 years of age who have taken part in various aspects of the sex trade (i.e. street-based, indoor, transactional), this discussion focuses on how they entered the trade, the types of sex trade work done and the relationships with their male clients. Among the most important findings is the diversity that informs the women's experiences across these fundamental aspects of the trade, which is best understood against the trajectory of these women's lives and their oscillating, complicated involvement in sex work over time. Unlike most studies of sex work entry, which contend that this is a singular occurrence, our participants experienced entry and re-entry many times as they transition between different types of sex work. Their involvement in the trade follows a basic pattern of beginning in privately arranged situations (i.e. exotic dancing, sugar daddies) and moving to primarily street-based work, a significant change that is mediated by structural and interpersonal factors like the loss of their children, inability to access social and health services and deepening addictions to drugs. The women's experiences with their male clients are also characterized by diversity and change according to the kind of sex work done and a constellation of mutable forces like socioeconomic need and drug dependency. Our findings, especially those regarding the factors affecting the women's transition to the most dangerous and criminalized form of sex work, street-based, represent important and much-needed information with which to develop tailored, effective social policies and service provision to make London's sex trade more supported and safer for the women who work here. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Canadian sex trade; Ethnographic sex work research; Female sex workers; Male clients of female sex workers; Sex work entry; Sex work typology",,"Orchard, T.; School of Health Studies, Western University, London, ON N6A 5B9, Canada; email: treena_orchard@yahoo.ca",,,18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

These films have been chosen according to the following criteria: representing different stages of dementia (early, moderate and advanced); films where the demented is the protagonist; and films challenging the biomedical view of dementia. Two of the characters are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease: the protagonist of Cortex (2008) is at a moderate stage, the one in Pandora's Box (2008) is diagnosed when already in advanced stage and the third, the protagonist of Old Cats (2010), while not officially diagnosed, is in early onset of dementia. While the number of dementia films has significantly increased during the past decade, only a few access the subjective world and acknowledge the personhood of people with dementia. Made outside the mainstream film industry, making elaborate use of cinematic image and metaphor, these films, each in its own particular cinematic idiom, succeed in conveying the psychological, social and spiritual realities of dementia as they are experienced from within the protagonist's psyche. While not denying the often bleak and painful aspects of dementia, these recent productions go against the grain, inspiring a complex, richly nuanced picture of dementia that centres around the protagonist's stubbornly courageous struggle to forge a meaningful existence even in the direst of circumstances. These films, we believe, offer a richer and profound understating of the human aspects embedded in the phenomena of dementia. © The Authors.","Alzheimer's disease; Cinema; Dementia; Personhood",,"Marcus, E.-L.; Acute Geriatric Department, Herzog Hospital, POB 3900, Jerusalem 91035, Israel; email: gerontology.israel@gmail.com",,,16528670,,,,"English","Int.

Reflecting the culture at large, studies of masculinity have presupposed an unspoken, static image of midlife men as the criterion for manhood. This essay reads the protagonist of No Country for Old Men, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, in the context of masculinity studies, age studies, and the evolution of the American Western. Both Cormac Mcarthy's novel and the Coen brothers' film adaptation will be addressed. We argue that, as a man who becomes deprived of the traditional props of ageless male identity, Bell offers an unexpected and intriguing instance of the search for late-life masculine identity. By the end of No Country for Old Men, Bell has departed from the traditional masculinity scripts of the American Western. He is an aging, ineffectual cowboy who has retired, renounced the violence that sustained his male dominance, and lost the moral certainty that ensured his identity. Bell is no longer certain of who he is - which leaves him free to find out what it might mean to be an old man. © The Authors.","""The Western""; Aging; American film; Cormac McCarthy; Identity; Masculinity; No Country for Old Men",,"Saxton, B.; Department of English, Rice University, 1753 West Alabama Street Apt. 3, Houston, TX77089, United States; email: saxtonb@gmail.com",,,16528670,,,,"English","Int.

However, time is usually reduced to chronometric time; a mere measurement that has been emptied of the narratives that were traditionally part of it. Its abstract and instrumental character implies that to become meaningful, chronometric time still depends on narratives. Not only are narratives needed to relate chronometric time to the world, they are also crucial to interrelate the dimensions of lived time: the past, the present and the future. As late modern aging takes place in multiform life worlds and in confrontation with a diversity of social systems, political and cultural macro-narratives play an important role in shaping situations and destinies of aging people. However, because of the prestigious exactness of chronometric time and the role it plays in calculations and statistics, narratives tend to creep in and remain hidden behind chronometric exactness. It is argued that micro-narratives remain important for empirical studies of aging as they articulate human experiences, but that narratives also play an increasingly important role in the interrelation between systemic worlds and life worlds. Therefore, narrative studies should seek more cooperation and critical discussion with disciplines that study macro developments such as sociology, economics or political science to clarify the role of macronarratives in policies on aging. The article ends with a contemporary example of new systemic (debt) clocks which have a major impact on the lives of many citizens, especially the aged. Although these clocks remain dependent on specific macro-narratives, their ominous ticking tends to hide them and to implode the debate about them. © The Author.","Aging and time; Interdisciplinary narrative analysis; Late modern life worlds; Systemic narratives",,"Baars, J.; Interpretative Gerontology, University of Humanistic Studies, Utrecht, Netherlands; email: info@janbaars.nl",,,16528670,,,,"English","Int.

These functionally different equality institutions build up into larger equality institutional architectures in which the different components serve complementary strategies in pursuing complex gender equality policies. Equality institutional architectures vary in how they institutionalize the relationships between gender inequality and other inequality categories. Layered, hierarchical, and integrated models of equality institutional architectures are identified as different in institutionalizing the intersections and hierarchies of different inequality axes. The article argues that analyzing equality institutions through such a conceptual framework contributes to a more nuanced research agenda for analyzing intersectionality in policy practice, one that could be applicable, beyond equality institutions, also to the analysis of policy texts and civil society mobilization patterns.

It is interesting to find that strengthened relations and established social networks formed in public spaces positively contribute to village women's daily lives, especially in the form of mutual aid when rural women need help during illness, need to borrow money for building a house, or need an extra hand to finish the harvest. Thus, through public spaces, rural women experience higher levels of mutual aid provided by the actors in their social networks, who can even replace the function of kinship to some extent by acting as a ""functional alternative.""

Specifically, if the proportion of child brides within a caste and village were to be reduced by half, the likelihood of a girl being a child bride would be reduced by about 20 percent. Parental literacy, caste, and having electricity in the home are also found to be significant.

These matchmakers face a beauty dilemma as they try to comply with their male clients' exacting and steep demands regarding the desired bride's beauty, while at the same time they wish to adhere to this Jewish religious ethos. Twenty-five national-religious Jewish matchmakers in Israel were interviewed. Findings show that they tend to cope with this dilemma by using two complementary strategies: On one hand they try, albeit unsuccessfully, to persuade their male clients to decrease the importance they attached to the appearance of the desired bride. On the other hand, they demonstrate a kind of pragmatic acceptance and compliance with the demands of their male clients; most of them tend to advise their female clients on how to improve their outward attractiveness in accordance to generally accepted standards of beauty, in order to promote their female clients' chances of finding a groom. In doing so, they unconsciously contribute to the perpetuation of the double standard of beauty and the sex objectification of women.","Backlash; Beauty standards; Israel; Jews; Matchmaking; Objectification",,"Bokek-Cohen, Y.; Department of Sociology, Ariel University Center of SamariaIsrael; email: ybokek@gmail.com",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878314010

Data analysis shows a satisfactory internal consistency of the BSRI and a good degree of similarity between Uyghur men's ratings and the Uyghur women's ratings for masculine and feminine traits. The BSRI seems to be more relevant for Uyghurs than Americans as the patterns of the desirability ratings arranged in rank seem traditionally gender typed.

It is clear that one of the platforms through which to articulate modernity in contemporary Malaysia is the consumption of popular culture. Promoted at first as an appropriate television genre to strengthen the agenda of Malaysian modernity, Asian soap opera has not been without its tensions. Some authorities have expressed anxiety over what they consider to be the negative influences of foreign issues of morality, which they believe might undermine the standards of Malay womanhood and compromise Malay cultural and national boundaries. Against this perception, however, we propose that urban Malay women negotiate their cultural resources to establish specific watching competencies with which to intelligently and adeptly engage foreign lifestyles in Asian soap operas imported to Malaysia. Watching competencies involve an active mobilization of those resources through which Malay women watch these soaps and measure their adherence to tradition. This paper will focus on how selected urban Malay women exercise their cultural resources, particularly those of adat (the traditional Malay custom as practiced by the Malays in Malaysia) and Islam, to form specific watching competencies for engaging with the depictions of complex inappropriate foreign lifestyles portrayed in Asian soap operas.","Asian soap operas; Islam; Malay women; Television consumption; Watching competency",,"Department of Media Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, University of Malaya, Malaysia, Malaysia",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878284952

Through the lens of semiotics, the author focuses on analyzing bridal magazines widely circulated in China's consumer culture. The analysis shows that China's evolving wedding industry adapts the trite, oppressive trope of ""romantic"" Western wedding rituals into a bricolage of global fashions, lifestyles, beauty regimens, and marriage tips for the Chinese bride. Conveniently tapping into the rhetoric of neoliberal consumerist agency and postfeminism, the wedding industry repackages patriarchal domination over the bride-to-be in the process of generating profits and disseminating the ideal of consumer one-upmanship. The author further argues that the modern Chinese bride, seemingly empowered within the opulent consumption at her wedding, neither escapes from the gender scripts of Chinese society nor celebrates a significant enhancement of her status in her marital relationship. In this regard, the bridal industry normalizes heterosexual matrimony and reinscribes women's subordinate position in marriage and love.","Bridal media texts; Gender scripts; Lavish weddings; Neoliberal consumerism; Postfeminism; The Chinese bride",,"Luo, W.; Indiana University, Purdue University, Fort Wayne, United States; email: luow@ipfw.edu",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878284967

With the changes in gender roles, family patterns, and demographic structure, the Taiwanese government has implemented leave policy changes to respond to the difficulties in work-family balance and the declining fertility rate. The development of leave policies in Taiwan can be generally divided into two stages according to the dimensions of policy changes. At the first stage, the changes were mostly on provision and regulatory framework. The enactment of the GEEL in 2002 introduced several new regulations on employers to provide paternity leave, family leave, parental leave, and flexible working time arrangements. At the second stage, the dimension of policy change moved to the reallocation of financial responsibilities, particularly the implementation of parental leave benefit. There were two important factors which made the reallocation of financial responsibilities feasible in the second stage. Firstly, the launch of the Employment Insurance provided the financial resources for policy makers to convert existing institutions to meet new needs. Secondly, the growing concern for the low fertility rate in Taiwan strengthened the imperative to redistribute financial responsibilities in leave policies to address this problem. After the changes in the 2000s, the responsibilities of employers in providing leave arrangements have been expanded. The state also strengthened its role in regulation. In terms of the dimension of finance, a large percentage of financial responsibilities have been transferred from families to employers and the state, mainly through the adoption of existing social insurance schemes. Overall, the pattern of leave policies in Taiwan is transforming from the stress on family responsibilities toward more employer and state responsibilities.","Leave policy; Parental leave; Taiwan; Welfare state restructuring; Work-family balance",,"Tsai, P.-Y.; National Taiwan University, Children and Family Research CenterTaiwan; email: peiyuen13@gmail.com",,,1225925X,,,,"English","Asian Women",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878330773

Similarly, at the end of the war, media manipulation of civilian traumas for a continuing political contest between the Sri Lankan Government and Tamil diasporic groups shut down other discursive frameworks. The more intimate stories of loss, bereavement, depression and grief were manipulated for a prolonged and bitter nationalist struggle. This article returns to a medium in which these stories were previously voiced, during the war years, in South Asian cinema. Due to government censorship of news media and limited access to the war zone, the local film industries proved to be the more cogent mediums for representing deep-rooted cultural anxieties to mainstream audiences. They conveyed everyday realities absent from news media in fictional interpretations of real events. Questions were raised regarding the affective memories and loyalties of the ethnic conflict and the role of women. The home, its destruction, displacement or re-inscription through violence became a central concern. This article focuses on three South Asian films that explored the subject of motherhood, homelessness and militarization of the ethno-cultural domestic sphere at the height of the ethnic conflict. Their shift from the urban public sites of military contest to private domestic spaces of civilian experience offered a cultural examination of political violence. By revisiting them as early conjectures of civilian trauma we ask how their interpretations of gender and place might be understood in the wake of the civil war. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","civil war; film; gender; home; homelessness; modernity","civil war; film; gender; modernity; political violence; Sri Lanka","Pieris, A.; Faculty of Architecture, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, 3010, Australia; email: apieris@unimelb.edu.au",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871188417

However, as Teresa de Lauretis and Gillian Rose argue, for feminism to remain relevant, it must also be attentive to the fluid hegemonic conditions of power, and thus, strive to evolve new 'forms', which emphasize feminism's political mobility. Developing this proposition, this article discusses how a new critical feminist mobility may be detected in the work of Sydney-based Malaysian artist Simryn Gill. Born in Singapore in 1959, and hailing from a migrant Punjabi family who first settled in Malaya in the 1920s, Gill constantly travels between her home in Sydney and her family bungalow in Port Dickson, a small coastal town in Malaysia. I will discuss how Gill's feminist perspective may be mapped through the artist's shifting spatial contexts by looking at three spaces - the gallery, the domestic interior and the tropics. Through these spaces, I will explore how the artist occupies the dual roles of 'woman' and 'women', thus demonstrating the changing and fluid energy of a mobile feminist stance. Gill's art valorizes the domestic sphere as a recurring theme with this subject being central to her self-definition in the public sphere. Yet, her treatment of domesticity is distinct in its furtiveness, a tactic, which I argue, enables a feminist agency that is politically mobile, and capable of engaging issues of gender, sexuality, race, class and citizenship. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","art; domesticity; feminism; feminist mobility; Southeast Asia","art; citizenship; class; gender; race; sexuality; Malaysia; Gillia","Chee, L.; National University of Singapore - Architecture, 4 Architecture Drive, Singapore, 117566, Singapore; email: l.chee@nus.edu.sg",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871199627

Huysuz Virjin [Cranky Virgin]. These three, I suggest, are the pioneers of contemporary Turkish queer performance. Their performances - both on- and off-stage - are validated through a reiterative absence of queerness in their everyday lives and stand in the midst of various negotiations between queers and the secular Islamic nation-state in Turkey. In the works of Müren, Ersoy, and Huysuz, the stage is suggestive of a space where queerness can be managed. It is a contested space that does at least allow for the communication of queer ideas to a wider audience. I discuss the works of these three performers as three variations of queerness in Turkey in relation to different eras and different political climates that are directly related to the nation-state's desire to perform modernity. While explicating complicated modes of gender performativity, I consider the stage as the primary space for a queer body to exist. Through this discussion, I aim to activate debates both within and against the context of secular Islam, on gendered political space, and on those overlooked sexualized spaces in which the nation-state produces powerful yet unstable values to manage queer subjectivity in contemporary Turkey. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","contemporary Turkey; gender performativity; queer; space; stage","gender; nation state; performance assessment; sexuality; Turkey","Selen, E.; Department of Communication Design, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Turkey; email: eselen@khas.edu.tr",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871239055

Through a combination of performativity theory and architecture theory, the article addresses social and historical constructions of gender and sexuality, complicit with the entities age, class and nationality, through architecture. Architecture is explored 'on the one hand' as a representation of social norms and 'on the other hand' as a practice which can subvert them. Departing from a performative perspective on identity, the term cross-cladding is introduced as a tool to interpret architecture as dressing and thereby its complex, layered and manifold performances of gender and sexualities. The article writes a social and architectural history of what has been called 'the most famous manor in Sweden and of Swedish manors the most famous in the world' (Sterner 1935, 4). Mårbacka was not simply the home of Selma Lagerlöf (1858-1940) and her kin but also a public display of this Nobel Prize-winning first woman of the Swedish Academy - a national monument. Lagerlöf continuously worked on the main building. In 1919-1924, it was transformed with the help of the architects' office of Isak Gustaf Clason. It also appears in Lagerlöf's novels and throughout the building there are references to her books and biography. There is something queer here. The master of Mårbacka was a woman who loved women and made room for a household of women. This article discusses how architecture can represent a gendered disguise and reveals Mårbacka as an excessive, patriarchal 'power suit', which enabled a lifestyle that deviated from the norms of society. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","architecture; camp; cladding; drag; manor house; performativity; queer","gender relations; sexuality; womens status; Sweden","Bonnevier, K.; Royal Institute of Technology, KTH - School of Architecture, Östermalmsg 26, Stockholm, 11262, Sweden; email: katarina.bonnevier@gmail.com",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871209775

The underlying premise is that space is never a homogenous, unified, neutral and a-priori entity that precedes subjects but emerges as the outcome of an ongoing production process which involves actors and material components. Heteropatriarchal understandings of space based on masculinist premises have largely ignored women and queer subjects who may subvert or alter normative spatial practices. The latter challenge established spatial typologies and their gendered associations, such as the house with women and the war zone with men. Furthermore, the practices of marginalized subjects point to alternative understandings of space based on fluid and porous boundaries between such dualities as materiality/representation, inside/outside and private/public. The contributors to this themed section analyze non-normative spatial practices by drawing from feminist and queer theories, postcolonial studies, architectural theory and geography. They focus on specific cases from a broad geographical span ranging from South Asia to Europe. Despite their different contextual foci, the following authors speak to each other by engaging in scholarship that resists disembodiment and by addressing the materiality of space as an arena of continuous production in relation to sexed bodies and sexualized identities.

Within this sometimes ""chilly"" microsystem, female students negotiated intrateam processes, which were in some cases affected by gender norms. Intrateam processes that influenced female students' project-based learning experiences included interpersonal dynamics; leadership; and division of labor. Study findings point toward ways that engineering educators might attend to the intrateam processes identified, and better accommodate the needs of all students in project-based introductory courses. © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.","Engineering teams; Female engineering students; Project-based learning",,"Swan, A.

However, research shows that girls develop poor attitudes about low achievement in science well before high school or college-specifically in middle school. In addition, even though many explanations for the lack of women in science include references to the gender stereotyping inherent in careers in science, few interventions examine the impact of science enrichment programs on participants' gender stereotypes in occupations. This intervention targeted middle school girls, evaluating the impact of the program on participants' science achievement and attitudes, self-esteem, occupational stereotypes, and self-efficacy in completing science course work before, during, and after the enrichment program, as well as their occupational self-efficacy after the intervention. This intervention included 118 girls who participated in a 3-year program that included summer camps, Saturday academies, and professional and community mentoring. The effects across pre- and post-tests showed improvements in achievement and attitudes toward learning science; findings typical of efficacious interventions. After a year, a follow-up survey of comparison and intervention group girls showed similar improvements in attitudes toward science and occupational self-efficacy. Perhaps the most intriguing findings are the trends for girls to moderate their stereotypical views of male-dominated occupations and to polarize their stereotypical views of female-dominated occupations. The findings from this intervention have implications for inoculating girls' attitudes toward learning science and their biases based on gender stereotypes of careers in science in order to increase their likelihood of pursuing careers in science instead of trying to reverse the loss of women in the pipeline at a later age. © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.","Middle school; Science enrichment; Women in science",,"Schumacher, M.; University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0086, United States; email: Carl.Leukefeld@uky.edu",,,10728325,,,,"English","J.

Under open enrollment, all students are allowed the choice to enroll in advanced classes. Therefore, school districts with such policies provide a strategic link between individual-level theories of student behavior and district-level data such as enrollment rates in Advanced Placement classes.

Given that opportunities for authentic research may support STEM advancement, we seek to maximize the number of students involved in research. Our Behavioral Research Advancements in Neuroscience (BRAIN) research program tests the hypothesis that a team-based collaborative-learning model not only provides research opportunities for more students, but also produces outcomes at least as positive as a traditional one-on-one apprenticeship model. We examined scientific research selfefficacy as a critical construct for measuring student outcomes and predicting student progress toward STEM careers. Here we provide descriptive portraits of four women who participated in BRAIN, integrating quantitative survey data with analysis of pre- and post- semistructured interviews. Although selected for different self-efficacy trajectories in the quantitative surveys, all four women described increased self-efficacy in interviews and emphasized mastery experiences as a source of self-efficacy. Two women illustrate one general outcome from the program: women overcame initially lower scientific research self-efficacy, matching self-efficacy among men by mid-program. The overarching study suggests that both team-based research and apprenticeships can raise scientific research self-efficacy, which predicts STEM career success. Therefore, this collaborative model provides a structure for authentic research at institutions that may lack available mentors, and yet aim to improve opportunities for diverse undergraduate groups to pursue STEM careers.

Students also completed prior experience and engineering attitude questionnaires. On the mechanical aptitude measures, male students scored higher than female students on the MAT and physics-based games at statistically significant levels. We examined correlations between prior experiences and MAT performance and found activities such as repairing things, using tools, and taking technical vocational skills courses to correlate most highly with MAT performance. The prior experience results showed that male students spent many more hours engaging in the activities with the strongest correlations to MAT performance. Based on the attitude survey results, the male students had more confidence in activities such as troubleshooting, creating mechanisms, and figuring out how things work than female students at statistically significant levels. Combined with the findings of others on the importance of practical skills in mechanical engineering work, our results suggest that exposure to more learning experiences that develop mechanical aptitude and confidence will attract more women to mechanical engineering study and careers.

Attempting to broaden participation, minority and multicultural engineering programs (MEPs) operate within institutional climates transformed by post-affirmative action policies, shrinking state funding, corporate influence, and ongoing social inequality. In this paper, the MEP at the University of Oklahoma (OU) serves as a case study to observe how one institution responded to changing economic and political forces and the resulting impact on student participants. To emphasize minority while maintaining a focus on diversity, the OU administration broadened the MEP mission to include First Generation students. This change coincided with the physical relocation of the MEP offices and a transition in MEP staff. Recognizing that underrepresented students' experiences are often marginalized and not always heard by policy makers, we analyzed 208 semistructured interviews of 138 engineering majors in search of insight about how those decisions were experienced by African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Native American undergraduate engineering students. For some students, the broadening of the program's mission and changes in personnel provided access to resources previously not proffered to them; other students expressed an acute sense of loss of program identity. Literature about organization change indicates that attention by the institution to multidirectional, culturally competent communication might have made these transitions less stressful for the disaffected students. Institutional recognition and understanding of diverse and sometimes competing cultures can effectively facilitate program restructuring motivated by social, political, and economic forces.

This underrepresentation is not only a social and cultural issue, but it is also cause for alarm with regard to the United States' ability to maintain its technological and economic dominance in the global economy. Research indicates that there are internal and external factors that affect the ability of women to see future success in SE and to identify with the masculine nature of SE. This study focuses on the role of identity in 26 women's decisions to persist or leave their SE undergraduate degree at the university level. The study utilizes multiple conceptions of identity negotiation to identify how each participant negotiated her own personal identity with that of the SE departmental culture of which she was a part. The findings reveal that only women who participate in redefinition strategies related to their marginalized status are able to persist; those who cannot redefine their marginality in relation to the dominant discourse of SE begin to lose interest or doubt their competence in the field, resulting in their departure from SE. The findings also illustrate additions to current identity frameworks to better understand the role of SE identity for leavers.

Female sex is known to have a protective effect on incidence, tumour characteristics, and mortality from melanoma. However, the potentially modifying effect of sex on the prognostic significance of clinicopathological and investigative factors is generally not taken into consideration in biomarker studies. In this study, we compared the sex-specific distribution and prognostic value of established tumour characteristics and Ki67 expression in 255 cases of incident primary melanoma in a prospective, population-based cohort study. Methods: The study included 255 incident cases of melanoma, 132 females and 123 males, in the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study. Tumours from 226 (88.6%) cases had been assembled in tissue microarrays. Clinicopathological factors and immunohistochemical Ki67 expression were assessed and correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank test and univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, stratified for gender. Effect of gender on melanoma-specific survival (MSS) after first recurrence was also analysed. Results: Women were significantly younger at diagnosis than men (p = 0.012). The most common tumour sites were the legs in women (37.5%) and the dorsal trunk in men (37.8%). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that tumour location had no prognostic impact in women, but in men, location to the frontal trunk was significantly associated with a reduced DFS compared with all other locations combined and location to the dorsal trunk was significantly associated with a prolonged OS. High Ki67 expression was significantly associated with a reduced DFS and OS in men but not in women, also when adjusted for other factors. In men, but not in women, ulceration was an independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS. MSS after first local, regional or distant recurrence was significantly shorter for men than for women. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate that the prognostic value of tumour location, Ki67 expression and ulceration in melanoma differs according to gender. These findings need to be validated in future studies, as they may help improve prognostication in patients with melanoma. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that sex-stratified analyses add valuable information to biomarker studies. © 2012 Fridberg et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Clinicopathological characteristics; Malignant melanoma; Prognosis; Sex",,"Jirström, K.; Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Pathology, Lund University, 221 85 Lund, Sweden; email: karin.jirstrom@med.lu.se",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Methods: An ad hoc cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a previously studied cohort. Participants were grouped by gender-specific age groups (5 to 9, 10 to 14 and 15 to 19 years). ApoA-I (apolipoprotein A-I) and HDL apoC-III were assayed by electroimmunoassay. ApoC-III was measured in whole plasma, and in HDL to determine the molar proportion to apoA-I. General linear models were used to assess association. Results: The HDL apoC-III to apoA-I molar ratio increased by BMI Z quartile in girls aged 10-14 years (p < 0.05 for linear trend, p < 0.05 for difference in BMI Z quartile IV vs. I to III) and aged 15-19 years (p < 0.05 for trend). In boys the increase by BMI Z occurred only at ages 15-19 years (p < 0.01 for trend and for quartile difference). Conclusions: ApoC-III showed an obesity-related increase relative to apoA-I during adolescence beginning in girls aged 10 to 14 years and in boys aged 15 to 19 years. The earlier changes in girls may alter HDL's protective properties on the β-cell and contribute to their increased risk for DM2. © 2012 Blackett et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adolescents; ApoC-III; Children; Gender; HDL",,"Blackett, P.R.; Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, OU Children's Physician's Bldg, 1200 N Phillips Ave, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, United States; email: piers-blackett@ouhsc.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

The objective of this study was to compare the effects of acute androgen administration on in vivo coronary conductance and in vitro coronary microvascular diameter in intact and castrated male swine. Methods: Pigs received intracoronary infusions of physiologic levels (1-100 nM) of testosterone, the metabolite 5á-dihydrotestosterone, and the epimer epitestosterone while left anterior descending coronary blood flow and mean arterial pressure were continuously monitored. Following sacrifice, coronary arterioles were isolated, cannulated, and exposed to physiologic concentrations (1-100 nM) of testosterone, 5á-dihydrotestosterone, and epitestosterone. To evaluate effects of the androgen receptor on acute androgen dilation responses, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry for androgen receptor were performed on conduit and resistance coronary vessels. Results: In vivo, testosterone and 5á-dihydrotestosterone produced greater increases in coronary conductance in the intact compared to the castrated males. In vitro, percent maximal dilation of microvessels was similar between intact and castrated males for testosterone and 5á-dihydrotestosterone. In both studies epitestosterone produced significant increases in conductance and microvessel diameter from baseline in the intact males. Androgen receptor mRNA expression and immunohistochemical staining were similar in intact and castrated males.

For example, audition has clear sex differences, which are related to serum testosterone levels. Of all major sensory systems only vision has not been examined for sex differences, which is surprising because occipital lobe (primary visual projection area) may have the highest density of testosterone receptors in the cortex. We have examined a basic visual function: spatial and temporal pattern resolution and acuity. Methods: We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision. They were screened with a battery of standard tests that examined acuity, color vision, and stereopsis. We sampled the visual system's contrast-sensitivity function (CSF) across the entire spatio-temporal space: 6 spatial frequencies at each of 5 temporal rates. Stimuli were gratings with sinusoidal luminance profiles generated on a special-purpose computer screen; their contrast was also sinusoidally modulated in time. We measured threshold contrasts using a criterion-free (forced-choice), adaptive psychophysical method (QUEST algorithm). Also, each individual's acuity limit was estimated by fitting his or her data with a model and extrapolating to find the spatial frequency corresponding to 100% contrast. Results: At a very low temporal rate, the spatial CSF was the canonical inverted-U; but for higher temporal rates, the maxima of the spatial CSFs shifted: Observers lost sensitivity at high spatial frequencies and gained sensitivity at low frequencies; also, all the maxima of the CSFs shifted by about the same amount in spatial frequency. Main effect: there was a significant (ANOVA) sex difference. Across the entire spatio-temporal domain, males were more sensitive, especially at higher spatial frequencies; similarly males had significantly better acuity at all temporal rates. Conclusion: As with other sensory systems, there are marked sex differences in vision. The CSFs we measure are largely determined by inputs from specific sets of thalamic neurons to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from thalamus to cortex is guided by cortex during embryogenesis. We suggest that testosterone plays a major role, leading to different connectivities in males and in females. But, for whatever reasons, we find that males have significantly greater sensitivity for fine detail and for rapidly moving stimuli. One interpretation is that this is consistent with sex roles in hunter-gatherer societies. © 2012 Abramov et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Abramov, I.; Brooklyn College, City University of New York, Brooklyn, NY 11210, United States; email: iabramov@brooklyn.cuny.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

However, how immune stress affects neural circuitry during development is not well known. We tested whether a prenatal immune challenge interferes with the development of social play and with neural circuits implicated in social behavior. Methods: Pregnant rats were given intraperitoneal injections of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS - 100 μg/kg) or saline on the 15th day of pregnancy. Offspring were tested for social play behaviors between postnatal days 26-40. Brains were harvested on postnatal day 45 and processed for arginine vasopressin (AVP) mRNA in situ hybridization. Results: In males, LPS treatment reduced the frequency of juvenile play behavior and reduced AVP mRNA expression in the medial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. These effects were not found in females. LPS treatment did not change AVP mRNA expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, or supraoptic nucleus of either sex, nor did it affect the sex difference in the size of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area. Conclusions: Given AVP's central role in regulating social behavior, the sexually dimorphic effects of prenatal LPS treatment on male AVP mRNA expression may contribute to the sexually dimorphic effect of LPS on male social play and may, therefore, increase understanding of factors that contribute to sex differences in social psychopathology. © 2012 Taylor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; Development; Lipopolysaccharides; Medial amygdaloid nucleus; Play behavior; Prenatal; SDN-POA; Sex differences",,"De Vries, G.J.; Center for Neuroendocrine Studies, Department of Psychology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, United States; email: devries@cns.umass.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

The primary aim of this study was to examine these associations in 584 incident colorectal cancer cases from a Swedish prospective population-based cohort including 28098 men and women. Methods: Seven anthropometric factors; height, weight, bodyfat percentage, hip circumference, waist circumference, BMI and waist-hip ratio (WHR) were categorized into quartiles of baseline anthropometric measurements. Relative risks of CRC, total risk as well as risk of different TNM stages, and risk of tumours located to the colon or rectum, were calculated for all cases, women and men, respectively, using multivariate Cox regression models. Results: Obesity, as defined by all anthropometric variables, was significantly associated with an overall increased risk of CRC in both women and men. While none of the anthropometric measures was significantly associated with risk of tumour (T)-stage 1 and 2 tumours, all anthropometric variables were significantly associated with an increased risk of T-stage 3 and 4, in particular in men. In men, increasing quartiles of weight, hip, waist, BMI and WHR were significantly associated with an increased risk of lymph node positive (N1 and N2) disease, and risk of both non-metastatic (M0) and metastatic (M1) disease. In women, there were no or weak associations between obesity and risk of node-positive disease, but statistically significant associations between increased weight, bodyfat percentage, hip, BMI and M0 disease. Interestingly, there was an increased risk of colon but not rectal cancer in men, and rectal but not colon cancer in women, by increased measures of weight, hip-, waist circumference and bodyfat percentage. Conclusions: This study is the first to show a relationship between obesity, measured as several different anthropometric factors, and an increased risk of colorectal cancer of more advanced clinical stage, in particular in men. These findings suggest that risk of CRC differs according to the method of characterising obesity, and also according to gender, location, and tumour stage. © 2012 Brandstedt et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Brändstedt, J.; Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Pathology, Lund University, Lund SE-221 85, Sweden; email: jenny.brandstedt@med.lu.se",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling has been shown to determine the severity of CVB3-induced myocarditis. No direct role for signaling through TLR2 had been shown in myocarditis although published studies show that cardiac myosin is an endogenous TLR2 ligand and stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression by dendritic cells in vitro. The goal of this study is to determine which TLRs show differential expression in CVB3 infected mice corresponding to male susceptibility and female resistance in this disease. Methods: Male and female C57Bl/6 mice were infected with 10 2 PFU CVB3 and killed on day 3 or 6 post infection. Hearts were evaluated for virus titer, myocardial inflammation, and TLR mRNA expression by PCR array and microarray analysis. Splenic lymphocytes only were evaluated by flow cytometry for the number of TLR+/CD3+, TLR+/CD4+, TLR+F4/80+ and TLR+/CD11c+ subpopulations and the mean fluorescence intensity to assess upregulation of TLR expression on these cells. Mice were additionally treated with PAM3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist) or ultrapure LPS (TLR4 agonist) on the same day as CVB3 infection or 3 days post infection to confirm their role in myocarditis susceptibility. Results: Despite equivalent viral titers, male C57Bl/6 mice develop more severe myocarditis than females by day 6 after infection. Microarray analysis shows a differential expression of TLR2 at day 3 with female mice having higher levels of TLR2 gene expression compared to males. Disease severity correlates to greater TLR4 protein expression on splenic lymphocytes in male mice 3 days after infection while resistance in females correlates to preferential TLR2 expression, especially in spleen lymphocytes. Treating male mice with PAM reduced mortality from 55% in control CVB3 infected animals to 10%. Treating female mice with LPS increased mortality from 0% in control infected animals to 60%. Conclusion: CVB3 infection causes an up-regulation of TLR2 in female and of TLR4 in male mice and this differential expression between the sexes contributes to disease resistance of females and susceptibility of males. While previous reports demonstrated a pathogenic role for TLR4 this is the first report that TLR2 is preferentially up-regulated in CVB3 infected female mice or that signaling through this TLR directly causes myocarditis resistance. © 2012 Roberts et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Huber, S.A.; Department of Pathology, Center for Immunology and Infectious Disease, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT, United States; email: sally.huber@uvm.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

There is a history of men and women perceiving color differently. However, all of these studies deal with higher cognitive functions which may be culture-biased. We study basic visual functions, such as color appearance, without reference to any objects. We present here a detailed analysis of sex differences in primary chromatic sensations. Methods: We tested large groups of young adults with normal vision, including spatial and temporal resolution, and stereopsis. Based on standard color-screening and anomaloscope data, we excluded all color-deficient observers. Stimuli were equi-luminant monochromatic lights across the spectrum. They were foveally-viewed flashes presented against a dark background. The elicited sensations were measured using magnitude estimation of hue and saturation. When the only permitted hue terms are red (R) yellow (Y), green (G), blue (B), alone or in combination, such hue descriptions are language-independent and the hue and saturation values can be used to derive a wide range of color-discrimination functions. Results: There were relatively small but clear and significant, differences between males and females in the hue sensations elicited by almost the entire spectrum. Generally, males required a slightly longer wavelength to experience the same hue as did females. The spectral loci of the unique hues are not correlated with anomaloscope matches; these matches are directly determined by the spectral sensitivities of L- and M-cones (genes for these cones are on the X-chromosomes). Nor are there correlations between loci of pairs of unique hues (R, Y, G, B). Wavelength-discrimination functions derived from the scaling data show that males have a broader range of poorer discrimination in the middle of the spectrum. The precise values for all the data depend on whether Newtonian or Maxwellian optics were used, but the sex differences were the same for both optical systems. Conclusion: As with our associated paper on spatio-temporal vision, there are marked sex differences in color vision. The color-appearances we measured are determined by inputs from thalamic neurons (LGN) to individual neurons in primary visual cortex. This convergence from LGN to cortex is guided by the cortex during embryogenesis.

This suggests that aging may affect muscle protein turnover differently in men and women. Methods: We measured the skeletal muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) by using stable isotope-labeled tracer methods during basal postabsorptive conditions and during a hyperaminoacidemic-hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp in eight young men (25-45 y), ten young women (25-45 y), ten old men (65-85 y) and ten old women (65-85 y). Results: The basal muscle protein FSR was not different in young and old men (0.040±0.004 and 0.043±0.005%·h-1, respectively) and combined insulin, glucose and amino acid infusion significantly increased the muscle protein FSR both in young (to 0.063±0.006%·h-1) and old (to 0.051±0.008%·h-1) men but the increase (0.023±0.004 vs. 0.009±0.004%·h-1, respectively) was ~60% less in the old men (P= 0.03). In contrast, the basal muscle protein FSR was ~30% greater in old than young women (0.060±0.003 vs. 0.046±0.004%·h-1, respectively; P&lt;0.05) and combined insulin, glucose and amino acid infusion significantly increased the muscle protein FSR in young (P&lt;0.01) but not in old women (P=0.10) so that the FSR was not different between young and old women during the clamp (0.074±0.006%·h-1 vs. 0.072±0.006%·h -1, respectively). Conclusions: There is sexual dimorphism in the age-related changes in muscle protein synthesis and thus the metabolic processes responsible for the age-related decline in muscle mass. © 2012 Smith et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Aging; Amino acid; Muscle protein turnover; Sarcopenia",,"Mittendorfer, B.; Division of Geriatrics and Nutritional Science, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid Avenue; Campus, Box 8031, Saint Louis MO 63110, United States; email: mittendb@wustl.edu",,,20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

In this way, she makes sense of a life that was marked by many breaches and losses. Her self-presentation was also encouraged by the fact that the Catholic Church of the Counter-Reformation sought to take advantage of the story of a woman who had abandoned husband and children to follow Christ and, so, provided her a stage upon which to display her tears. She was thus able to transcend the limits imposed upon her gender and to give new meanings to established tradition.

In these letters she used the vocabulary of kinship to create the ties that she deemed necessary. Ideally she was supposed to become the wife of a chief whom, through her, the colonial government would have kept under their influence. In return, she was promised a patch of land of her own. When the marriage plans failed, Emma lost her privileged status and gradually turned into a women who ""wore red ocre"", a cosmetically applied substance that the colonisers considered a symbol of indigene backwardness. In the hierarchical order of colonial globalisation, she lost the scope of agency - although she never gave it up completely. Emma Sandile's story provides us with an opportunity to observe an agent of globalisation who, like many around her, became embroiled in the transformations of 19th century colonialism.

As the wife of Sergei M. Dukhovskoi, a high-ranking dignitary of the Tsarist regime, who - among other offices - served as governor-general in the Amur province and in Russian Turkestan, Dukhovskaia was part of the mobile imperial elite who came into close contact with the cultural, geographical and political diversity of the Tsarist realm in the last decades of the 19th century. The article examines how Dukhovskaia reflected in her memoires the experience of the nomadic life that the representatives of the autocratic regime had to lead. How did she locate Russia and the empire's peripheries on her mental maps? How did she describe her own role as female spectator and actor on the stage of Russia's ""scenarios of power""? Autobiographies like those of V. Dukhovskaia are of great value for the writing of ""imperial biographies"". They are helpful in the analysis of both self-images of the imperial elite and the emotional dimension of imperial rule. Autobiographical texts written by women are particularly disctinctive, since their discoursive boundaries differ from those of autobiographical texts written by men.

It is based on transnational comparative research, and compares the experiences and meanings about motherhood and mother/daughter relationships, especially referring to sexuality and reproductive health. The two contexts we have chosen for this chapter are drawn from our data on Indonesian and Canadian women. While these women come from culturally diverse situations, we find continuities between their experiences as well as contrasts in the contexts in which they live their reproductive lives. Methodology - Our study was based on collecting participant driven narratives focused on their experience of their reproductive lives. We interviewed women from three generations in the same families to secure a longitudinal perspective and to examine the relationships between generations in the same family. Our overall purpose was to examine the role of local culture in the social reproduction of women's lives in the family. Findings - The findings we discuss in this chapter focus on the continuities and contrasts we found in women's experience as lived in very different cultural, religious, and political contexts. Indonesian and Canadian women are struggling to live healthy and meaningful lives in a world that is changing ideologically, culturally, politically, and economically. We identify some key problems faced by women, especially as they negotiate the difficult terrain of sexuality, and suggest some points of entry in solving them. Originality/value - The originality of the article lies in the close examination of in-depth, qualitative data on family relationships, especially in contrasting cultural situations. We also think that our approach, which focuses on generations of women in the same families, provides us with a unique perspective on how relationships and especially women's experience of their reproductive and sexual lives are closely related to the way in which culture is mediated in families.

Findings - The index of dissimilarity based on the data shows that gender occupational segregation for migrant workers exists. The result of Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition shows that the unobserved effects account for more than three-fourths of the total gender occupational segregation. Research limitations - The ""index problem"" and the assumption of the same occupational preference between men and women of the Oaxaca- Blinder decomposition need to be addressed further. Social implications - The existing gender equality policies and social protection confined to urban workers should be extended to migrant workers. Increasing training investment in migrant workers is also recommended.

Approach - The frameworks of traveling theory (Said, 1984; Min, 2005) and global social policy and international relations approaches to policy transfer such as policy entrepreneurs (Stone, 2001) are used to discuss the different domestic violence policy trajectories in the two countries. Social implications - It is shown that in China, where activism and policy development concerning domestic violence is relatively recent, global social policy and transnational alliances created via international and global meetings have enabled activists to draw on ideas and policy frameworks from outside the nation-state to develop a specifically Chinese policy agenda. In England, where there is a longer history of debate and policy development regarding domestic violence, global social policy and transnational links have more recently become important to activists and academics wanting to shift policy developments further and to place them within a framework of gendered inequality and human rights. Findings - The chapter considers action and policy development related to domestic violence, comparing these across the very different contexts of England and China by using the ideas of traveling theory and policy networks. It is shown that use by Chinese of pressure from ""within"" and ""at the margins"" of the state has proven effective in challenging and developing domestic violence policy, while in England a combination of pressure from ""outside"" the state and mainstreaming has enabled activists to develop the policy agenda in positive, if fragile, ways. Originality/values of chapter - In both China and England, there is evidence of policy entrepreneurs traveling policy ideas into the countries, where they are contested and incorporated. The particular sociopolitical contexts of women's movements and networks influence policy development across the different localities. Within the Chinese context, activists have used pressure from ""within"" and ""at the margins"" of the state to effectively challenge and develop domestic violence policy. English activists have instead used pressure from ""outside"" the state to develop and shape domestic violence policy in England.

Methodology - The data was gathered as part of a major fieldwork project that included in-depth interviews and participant observation. Findings - The research reveals a kind of transnational motherhood, which is invisible in the academic field. The strategy for work-family balance of the Chinese in Spain situates the mothers primarily in their productive dimension. Management of the work-family balance (the productive and reproductive work) depends on the phase of the family business path. Chinese families enact two different strategies for balancing work-family life: ""transnationalized"" reproduction and ""externalized"" reproduction. In both strategies, Chinese women do not engage in intensive motherhood, but at the same time they do remain highly involved in the home. The analysis of the productive-reproductive continuum shows the complexity of the gender relationships within the Chinese family enterprise. Theoretical implications - Fieldwork data discloses a dynamic social relationship and suggest a revision of the theoretical assumptions used to explain the links among gender, work, and family in transnational space. Practical implications - As global immigration continues to grow, adjustments and flexibility will be required of all parties. Immigrant families will have to contend with family reunification policies that vary from nation to nation. Because immigrant family dynamics can be culture-specific, receiving nations will require flexible policies in housing, education, and other sectors.

Through a Black feminist theory lens, the convergence of the historical traditions, practices and institutions within the Black community are examined as to how they enable Black women to effectively care for their families. Additionally, the cultural strengths of the Black community are highlighted to further elucidate how they help Black women resist the hegemonic perceptions of Black single mothers as unfit. Methodology - To explain the cultural resources leveraged by Black women in poverty to raise their families, qualitative analysis of the existing peer-reviewed literature focusing on a range of topics specific to the Black community and family were utilized. The United States Census Bureau data were used to describe the target population and to better inform the overall analysis. Findings - Despite the stereotypes and obstacles faced by single Black mothers in poverty, characteristics specific to the Black community, and Black women in particular, have enabled them to establish communities, networks, and environments that help them care for and raise their children. Social implications - Attention to the sociohistorical experiences of the Black community and family must be paid in order to understand singlemother family formation within the Black community. Moreover, greater understanding of the cultural strengths of the Black community must be acknowledged in order to better comprehend how single Black women living in poverty are able to effectively sustain families and defy stereotypes. Originality/value of chapter - Previous analyses of families headed by low-income Black women have often taken a negative, if not judgmental, approach. This analysis takes a different approach. In addition to exploring the structural and historical origins of families headed by lowincome Black women, it highlights the strengths born out of the cultural practices and traditions of the Black community and family.

This study investigates the interplay between Chinese patriarchal values and neoliberal ideas that have shaped the Happiness Project - Action to Aid Impoverished Mothers - an official population control program that has been combined with poverty reduction ""Action."" Methodology - This research began in 2001 in Sichuan Province, Southwest China. Over a period of three years I interviewed 48 women who were participants in the Happiness Project. Findings - The goal of the Happiness Project is to bring ""happiness"" to poor mothers through the introduction of microcredit, literacy programs, and the improvement of reproductive health. Three maternal aspects of the Happiness Project, as the study indicates, coincide with three particular patriarchal values. These include an official construction of a good mother image, targeting women's bodies as objects of the state's population control, and reinforcing gender stereotypes through market activity. The findings of this research suggest that feminization of family survival coincided with achieving the goal of the Project. Mothers thus have carried a double burden on behalf of the Chinese state and their families: the goals of declining fertility and increasing family prosperity. Social implications - Based on this outcome, the study not only calls for reevaluating this ""women-only"" economic development model, but also calls into question whether bringing Chinese women into public production/ market activity is a path to women's emancipation under neoliberalism.

Methodology - The chapter is based on 1 year of ethnographic fieldwork that included a review of secondary sources, participant observation, and in-depth interviews with Filipinas and Korean men. Findings - The chapter shows the ways in which the UC reinforces the dominant discourse of gendered desire that portrays marriage migrants as women who wish to migrate mainly to marry a man who can provide economic stability. Filipina migrants, however, infuse the cultural discourse of romantic love into their decisions about husbands and marriage migration. Lastly, as the UC delineates normative heterosexual practices based on its religious doctrines, the church becomes a ""regime of normalization"" for traditional patriarchal heteronormativity. Social implications - The chapter contributes to the idea that gender and sexuality are socially constructed and constitutive of migration. Originality/value of chapter - The chapter examines not only the matchmaking role of an intermediary agency that facilitates cross-border marriages but also the agency's role in re/constructing gendered desire. Further, the chapter contributes to an understudied area: the social process of reconstructing heteronormativity in a transnational context.

The Canadian study focused on the examination of student experiences with respect to specific 'difficult' content in the classroom. The purpose of the study was to identify ways that were effective and engaging for students to learn. The UK study examined issues of access, retention and drop-out of non-traditional students in higher education. The study examined the learning experiences of women who returned to learning after being out of the education system for some time. Methodology - The Canadian study used surveys and interviews. Participants were recruited on the basis of their enrolment in specific classes. The UK study used interview samples drawn from student data in three universities. In each university, a cohort was followed and interviewed three times while in another cohort students were interviewed in their first year of study and different cohort in their final year of study. Approach - Both studies use a feminist, narrative approach that relies on reflexive engagement in the research process. Findings and implications - The studies highlight that the classroom is a place where dialogue and engagement occur; where the identities of the participants and their learning are in a dynamic process; and where the learners challenge attitudes and ideologies such as capitalism and forms of marginalisation. The studies revealed that learning has a social value and entreats women to reconsider their lives, work and citizenship.

In that context, a wave of consumerism and nostalgia for cultural tradition become two of the key factors that shield patriarchy and resist feminism. Method - Quantitative and qualitative responses of Chinese university students to video productions from South Korea and the United States are studied, compared, and contrasted by using survey and focus group discussion methods. Findings - Women and men students show preference for different types of televised and film entertainment. Both respond to the gender discourses depicted, seeing in them models for behavior and fashion. The independence and sexual freedom reflected in TV series from the United States is seen by many as less applicable to the Chinese context than the idealized traditionalism of the Korean series. Social implications - Global culture provides alternative and competing gender discourses, which can lead to social change or to nostalgia for an idealized tradition in the face of change. To the extent that both women and men adopt the male gaze, patriarchal culture is strengthened, not challenged in the process.

Methodology - A work climate survey was sent to the entire population of 341 tenured and tenure-track faculty at two small highly selective private liberal arts colleges, one formerly all male and the other formerly all female. The response rate was 70%, yielding 237 respondents. Faculty were compared by gender using t-tests and by gender and discipline using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multiple regression was used to examine factors contributing to faculty WFC. Findings - Gender, rank, and department climate were significantly associated with WFC. In contrast, caregiving responsibilities, college of employment, and discipline did not have significant relationships with WFC. Controlling for caregiving, employment at a formerly all-male college, working in a STEM discipline, and department climate did not reduce the effect of gender on WFC. Women faculty reported more WFC than their male counterparts, while full professors reported less than their junior colleagues. Good department climate overall as well as high scores on all three subscales individually (affective, instrumental, and cognitive) reduced WFC. Research limitations - This research project is a cross-sectional, observational study, which limits the interpretation of direction of effect in most cases. Practical implications - Results suggest that more supportive department climates could reduce WFC for faculty struggling to balance their personal and professional lives.

Findings - The embedding of gender in education did not follow a smooth path in terms of policy formulation. Feminist activists drove the process of reform by retaining control over the naming of the legislation, and its wording, thus preserving the language and imperatives of gender equity.

The purpose is to understand the impact of marketization on gender configuration through the lens of the work-family nexus. Research design - Data come from in-depth interviews conducted between 2005 and 2007 with 115 married women in four large cities. For analytical purposes, the informants were divided into three groups: stay-at-home moms, family-orientated working women, and work/career-oriented women. Findings - Although market reform may create opportunities for some women to enhance their personal lives, as a consequence of workers' loss of the safety net and welfare benefits, the neglect of women's reproductive work, and the commercialization of child care and child education, it has generated, for many women, much role conflict between work and family. Work/career-oriented women are able to actively engage in market activities precisely because they are protected still by the state, can afford commercial services of domestic tasks, or have strong support from their extended families. Originality/value - Women's varying role orientations reflect more their strategies of coping with structural changes than their mere adherence to certain gender ideologies. Social implications - The chapter calls for curbing unbridled market forces and restoring public services so as to create a family/womenfriendly work and social environment.

It is argued that post-structuralist thought regarding gender can illuminate some of the problems inherent within the UK legal system's treatment of transsexualsand particularly focuses on the work of Judith Butler. There is further detailed consideration of the UK legal system's treatment of transsexuals prior to the Gender Recognition Act and a response to some of the criticisms levelled at the applicability of Butlerian thought to realworld scenarios. © 2012 Journal of International Women's Studies.","Gender recognition act 2004; Judith butler; Transsexuals",,"Harris, A.; International Human Rights and Terrorism, Lancaster UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: alexharris06@gmail.com",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

With good reason, such research has often preferred to focus on general intellectual currents rather than individual cases. This paper, however, focuses on some common constructions of one feminist in particular: philosopher and theologian Mary Daly (1928-2010). I hope to demonstrate that an analysis of one individual's positioning within feminism's history, as well as in relation to a conception of correct intellectual practice for women's studies, can prove useful for broader attempts to make more complex our conceptions of feminist chronology, as well as for scholarship seeking to interrogate the institutional factors feeding into suchstories. Through readings of both Daly's own texts and those of her critics, this paper seeks to understand Daly's positioning both in a common history of feminist progression, and in a concomitant story about the type of intellectual work appropriate to women's studies. The central claim is that, in the constructions of Daly I examine, she is positionedas spatially external to the community and conversation of women's studies as academic discipline, as well as temporally behind that conversation. This positioning is not unilateral, but itself feeds off as well as into Daly's own self-positioning in relation to women's studies. The constructions of Daly I am figuring are therefore not impositions but rather works of communal construction to some extent, since both Daly and her critics areintellectual agents who produce, maintain and modify stories about feminist history as wellas women's studies as discipline.","Historiography; Mary daly; Women's studies",,"Telling, K.; University of NottinghamUnited Kingdom; email: kathryn.telling@googlemail.com",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

The actions of entering thetheatre and sitting for an hour, or of clicking 'play', appear to be simple gestures for the acquisition of knowledge; this paper explores the complexity of the processes surrounding the lecture, and the way in which the lecture constructs a passive listening position for the audience. The exploration takes place in the frame of one such lecture: the inaugural lecture of the Bocconi annual series at Bocconi University, Italy, entitled ""Gender Equality and Economic Development"", held in 2010. The author watched this lecture on the Internet in order to gain knowledge of the place of 'gender' in Development Economics; the paper represents in part the author's struggle with expectations of a feminist stance. The paper is an attempt to find an active listening stance, and to interrogate the author's reaction to the lecture. The first section of the paper addresses the presentation ofinformation in the lecture, how it is established as an Economics lecture on gender. Categories of feminist economics: access feminism, empiricist feminism, difference feminism, and the newer position of gender awareness, are aligned with the lecture. The second section, which analyses the position of the lecturer, situates the lecture in the ongoing processes that establish the lecture as an event, the lecturer as an expert in Economics. Finally, the overt agenda of the lecture, as laid out in the literature on the art of lecturing, is juxtaposed with the covert processes of academic identity construction.","Feminism in academia; Gender economics; Lecturing",,"Henderson, E.; University of LondonUnited Kingdom; email: emily_frascatore@hotmail.com",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

While much of this research asks how antiwar activities and war are predicated upon dominant gender ideals and focuses in particular on women's experiences, this article aims to explore how some wartime events, specifically antiwar activism, constitutes or reconstitutes gender. Focusing on the United States' anti-Vietnam War history, I examine how activists cemented, challenged and madeanew notions of femininity and masculinity within and through this antiwar arena. I arguethat both women and men activists created opportunities within the anti-Vietnam War movement to reconceptualise links between war and gender. Though feminist scholars have elucidated the splits that occurred amongst these women activists, this article seeks to situate these divisions within contested understandings of femininity, as well as to extend scholarly exploration into competing notions of antiwar masculinities.","Anti-vietnam war movement; Femininity; Masculinity",,"Burgin, S.; University of LeedsUnited Kingdom; email: hy08snb@leeds.ac.uk",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

We explore media representations of wilderness recreation as a possible agent in the gender socialization process that dissuades women from participation. Through analyzing advertisements from the 42 issues of Backpacker and Outside magazines published in 2008 and 2009 we find that, when women are shown, they are portrayed as having limited and passive roles in wilderness recreation. These advertisements also use the setting to reinforce traditional gender arrangements and paint women as consumers rather than conquerors of the wild.

Broadly defined as a biopolitical ideal, post-feminism is here related to a set of principles of the neoliberal art of government. It will be argued that these principles ethically sustain the exponential mainstreaming of a post-feminist hermeneutics of adolescence and its programme of governmentality. The article also links post-feminism to a particular methodology of subjectification, ultimately locating its hermeneutics of adolescence within the pornographic and pharmacological imperatives of contemporary capitalism. On the empirical level, the analysis explores how techno-scientific discourses and bodily figurations (namely brains and hormones) enter the discursive apparatus of a Portuguese girls' magazine, giving ideological ground to a distinctive production of adolescent body-subjects. Post-feminist media markets are finally discussed as a significant segment of the capitalist industrialisation of sexual difference that frames the general problematic of this study. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Girls' magazines; governmentality; post-feminism; sexual difference; techno-science",,"Pinto, P.Rua do Loreto, 55 - 3o C, Lisboa 1200 - 241, Portugal; email: pierrelepoint@hotmail.com",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Inspired by Donna Haraway's (1997) and Karen Barad's (2007) theorising, I understand diffractive analysis as an embodied engagement with the materiality of research data: a becoming-with the data as researcher. Understanding the body as a space of transit, a series of open-ended systems in interaction with the material-discursive 'environment', diffractive analyses constitute transcorporeal engagements with data. Stacy Alaimo's (2010) theorisation of the transcorporeal is put to work diffractively with Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's (1987) thinking on the process of becoming minor or minoritarian. This implies a reconceptualisation of the very act of thinking as a transcorporeal process of engagement, going beyond the idea of reflexivity and interpretation as inner mental activities taking place in the mind of the researcher understood as separated from the data. Through my example, I argue that diffractive analysis can make visible new kinds of material-discursive realities that can have transformative and political consequences. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Barad; Deleuze; diffractive analysis; material-discursive; postconstructionism; transcorporeal",,"Taguchi, H.

And to what extent is feminist theory and research recognised as such? I draw on material from an ethnographic study of academia in Portugal to examine the claims that non-feminist scholars make in classrooms and conferences about the epistemic status of feminist scholarship. I observed that feminist work was very commonly described as capable of generating credible and valuable knowledge, but only in some instances and in limited ways. I present examples of these adversative claims (i.e. propositions that express opposition or discrepancy through a 'but' or equivalent adversative conjunction) and analyse their structure, content and uses of caricature and humour, showing how epistemic boundaries are drawn in them and how feminist scholarship is positioned in relation to those boundaries. I argue that this boundary-work produces a representation of feminist scholarship as being located partly within, and partly outside, the realm of proper knowledge, a move which I designate as an epistemic splitting of that scholarship. I suggest that this splitting enables and legitimates a selective engagement with feminist work, because it provides non-feminist scholars with a recognised epistemological rationale for taking into account the feminist insights which broadly fit mainstream frameworks, while simultaneously rejecting as epistemologically unsound the feminist critiques of those frameworks. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Academia; epistemology; ethnography; feminist theory; gender studies; knowledge; Portugal; women's studies",,"Pereira, M.

The first novel, Häutungen [Shedding], appeared in the mid-1970s at the peak of the New German Women's Movement and went on to become one of the most important feminist fictional texts. The second novel, Feuchtgebiete [Wetlands] was published in 2008 in the wake of what has been called postfeminism. Both books are discovery narratives about young women coming of age and both have been heralded by the media as having ruptured sexual taboos and old ways of talking about women's bodies and sexuality. In different ways, both have also been influential in feminist and postfeminist debates about the possibilities for empowering women as sexual subjects. Both texts show how fiction can draw upon and help shape a transgressive sexual politics, making it instrumental in women's sexual empowerment. In this article, we examine the resonances and the differences between these two texts, paying particular attention to the kind of narratives that are produced and how in each case a sexual subject is constructed in and through the text. Specific exclusions in terms of race, ethnicity, class, and sexuality are explored, as well as the sexual political strategies that each text generates with an eye toward the possibilities each creates for women's sexual (dis)empowerment and critique of normalised sexuality. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Abjection; agency; embodiment; feminism; normalisation; postfeminism; sexuality; textual politics; transgression",,"Binswanger, C.; Zentrum Gender Studies, Universität Basel, Steinengraben 5, Basel CH-4051, Switzerland; email: christa.binswanger@unibas.ch",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Major themes deriving from analysis of the interviews were all related to the engagement of the participants with the programs on four different levels. These themes, which are developmentally related, are (1) a disclosure which makes sexual assault a personal issue at the same time that it reveals a lack of knowledge and skills on the part of the respondents, (2) the evaluation of the approach of individual programs, (3) the evaluation of the relative effectiveness of the approacher, and (4) the creation of a social context which the engagement facilitates. Overall, we find that when the men in our study were approached in a nonconfrontational, alliance-building fashion by other men, they reported that their knowledge related to sexual assault, their empathy toward sexual assault survivors, and their motivation to actively engage in the prevention of sexual violence all increased.

The regularly applied active/passive dichotomy is challenged by the agency and skill of these women, but, simultaneously, their position is undermined by an emphasis on the body, relationships with male characters, and the demands of patriarchy. Indeed, Jeffrey A. Brown (1996) argues that a female in an action role is simply a 'sheep in wolf's clothing'. This paper will explore Brown's claim by focusing on the 1980s sword and sorcery cycle, in particular the often critically overlooked Conan the Destroyer (1984) and Red Sonja (1985). In these narratives, women are seemingly elevated from subsidiary roles to become action heroines or formidable villains. Moreover, the films facilitate discussions of the women as warriors, women as powerful malevolent forces, but also engage with broader issues surrounding the representation of gender, sexuality, race, and the female body. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","femininity; gender; muscles; representation; sexuality; sword and sorcery cinema",,"Wright, A.; Department of English and History, Edge Hill University, Ormskirk, Lancashire, United Kingdom; email: wrighta@edgehill.ac.uk",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

The authors of this paper view alcohol-related behaviour as one particular sphere of practice through which gender may be performed and normative gender identities accomplished. The authors ask where the next generations of alcohol consumers learn to 'do' gender in relation to alcohol. We argue that the depictions and treatments of alcohol-related behaviour to be found in the magazines that young people claim to read may function as one very important cultural resource in this respect. The paper subsequently offers an analysis and discussion of the ways in which alcohol and alcohol-related behaviour is depicted within a range of magazines read by 11-18-year-olds in the UK. The analysis presented herein illustrates that the treatment of alcohol-related behaviour in these magazines is indeed highly gendered and gendering. Males and females are depicted as engaging in different drinking practices, for different purposes, in different contexts, and to different consequences/effects for instance. Furthermore, the way in which the alcohol-related behaviours of males and females are treated in these magazines varies considerably between those magazines targeted at males and those targeted at females. It is thus acknowledged that these magazines might have a crucial role to play in the reproduction of gender in relation to alcohol-related behaviour specifically. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","alcohol; gender; magazines; media; young people",,"Atkinson, A.

It examines the discourses and practices of liberal interventionism, focusing on the Office of the High Representative (OHR) as a crucial site for the constitution of gendered subjects and agents in this post-conflict zone. Drawing on poststructural theories and representations of Balkan identity, it explores the gendered articulations of Paddy Ashdown, first during his wartime visits to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and second, during his tenure as High Representative. A discourse-theoretical analysis highlights how Ashdown rationalized his involvement in wartime Bosnia-Herzegovina through a powerful self-identification with an 'interventionist model of masculinity' which equates manliness with a responsibility to protect a vulnerable/backward/feminized Balkan 'other' from violence and harm. Moreover, gendered discourses helped to conceptualize and legitimate the peace implementation role of the OHR, allowing the organization to position coercive strategies and policies as appropriate and necessary for creating sustainable peace. Overall, this article highlights how gender is mobilized to promote and impose liberal policies and norms, with significant implications for the quality of peace being (re)constructed. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Balkanism; Bosnia; Discourse; Gender; Identity; Liberal peace; Masculinities; Peacebuilding; Statebuilding",,"O'Reilly, M.; King's College LondonUnited Kingdom",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

Yet the significance of the military uniform can only be grasped if read against a performative concept of the gentlemanly state, emphasizing that the abstraction from violence is constitutive to military masculinities. Thus the powerful function of soldierly costume can be understood as one of demarcating boundaries of gentlemanly statehood: dressed in military attire, the soldier is authorized to use 'civilized force'. Based on this conceptual argument, I trace the uniform's imperial reconfigurations, before describing themanifold historical strands of meaning that have been woven into its contemporary fabric in Thailand. Exploring the gentlemanly connotations attached to the soldiers' costume by girls in Thailand's southern provinces, I moreover argue that its favourable contours have to be read in light of military counterinsurgency practices that have intensified the vestimentary encoding of gendered, religious and ethnic difference. In this context, themilitary uniform has been attached to Thai notions of gentlemanly modernity, encompassing gentlemanly manners, light skin as well as fashionable progress.

As one aspect of a wider project to illuminate concerns of security and the masculinized world of the private security contractor, I develop the concept of fratriarchy to bring into sharp relief the potential consequence of contractors' relative operational freedom within the context of close, yet sometimes competitive brotherly relations. Here, I go on to consider the means by which a small group of US Embassy guards in Kabul created dense intra-masculine bonds within a wider hierarchy of men through norm-bound, homoerotic practices. From the view of those involved, these practices may well have neutralized the threat of homosexuality through cementing heteronormative relations among the hegemonic members. In discussing three images depicting sexualized activities drawn from the 2009 Kabul Hazing, I argue that intimate forms of embodiment intersect with processes of racialization in politically important ways. In conclusion, it is tentatively argued that the Kabul Hazing and wider discussions of the industry conceived of through the lens of fratriarchy provide the emerging feminist security studies literature with a closely focused resource with which to augment claims located at higher levels of abstraction around the process of (re)masculinization argued to be underway in this exemplary sphere. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Accountability; Fratriarchy; Heteronormativity; Masculinities; PMSC; Racialization",,"Higate, P.; University of BristolUnited Kingdom",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

The issue of public attitudes to such primary women's rights and feminist issues as abortion has been important in Australia for many years, but there is no body of research literature here on the electoral salience of those attitudes to abortion. In contrast, a body of US literature indicates that attitudes to abortion there are of significance in predicting voters' choices at state and federal levels and that this significance has increased over time. My argument is that there are no significant patterns of voting or even of party identification that are dependent on parliamentary candidates' views on abortion in Australia, and that this has been the case for at least 30 years. My argument is made through exploring opinion polls and academic surveys; examining three anecdotal claims of electoral retribution; and looking in detail at the case of the defeat of Barry Simon in the 1980 federal election. My finding as to the non-salience of the issue of abortion among Australian voters has significance in terms of accurately identifying obstacles to feminist proposals for reform of abortion laws in Australia. One of the aims of the article is to dispel the myth that politicians who are pro-choice or who vote for abortion reform are likely to face electoral retribution on that score.

Using 'Australia's Singing Cowboy' Tex Morton as a case study, we show that this sentimentality became part of both the bush tradition and country music in Depression- and Second World War-era Australia, associated with the bushworker or rugged 'lone hand'. This sentimentality was deeply problematic from a feminist perspective, as indeed was Morton's personal life. It romanticised what he called 'the sins of the son'; that is, the lone hand's inability to do right by those he loved. It also glamorised his tears and self-pity, treating them as signs of his hardy masculinity. Given the significance of this form of sentimentality both in Australia and elsewhere over the rest of the twentieth century, feminist scholars of popular culture and historians of gender and the emotions need to pay more attention to country music songs about errant sons and lovers from the 1930s and 1940s. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Bellanta, M.; Centre for Critical and Cultural Studies, University of QueenslandAustralia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

As part of my study of the women's movement online and feminist blog networks in Australia, I provide a review of several of these concepts, interrogating their applicability to the study of online communities. This paper explores the relevance of the social movement theory concepts of submerged networks, abeyance structures and the related idea of counterpublics for the study of feminist blog networks. In 2009, the radio station Triple J's 'Hottest 100 of All Time' poll featured no solo women artists, and women played on few tracks. In response to this, several strands of discourse developed in the Australian feminist blogosphere identifying ways that the history of rock music excludes or erases women. Activists developed a cross-platform poll on Twitter, Facebook and email, and promoted it through blogs and Twitter, to counter the 'Hottest 100 Men' with a 'Hottest 100 Women'.

The empirical data employed in the study consists of the agony column of the Finnish magazine City and the readers' online responses to it. The column explores sexual differences and makes a variety of desires public, but also participates in the mass-mediated regulation of sexualities. Furthermore, it parodies the agony column convention, apparently operating as a way to resist formal sex education discourses and normative understandings of sexuality, yet ultimately it contributes to shaping sexual norms in nuanced ways. My research query has three parts. In the first, I focus on the ambivalent construction of normative heterosexuality through emotional mediation and questions of taste. In the second, I examine the connections between non-normative sexualities and other forms of cultural 'otherness'. In the third, I trace the online responses from readers in order to understand how sexual norms are negotiated.

Focusing on the hit film about a family headed by two moms - The Kids Are All Right - I wonder what representations of gay kinship push at the boundaries of familial normativity and which ones simply paint the traditional picket fence in rainbow hues? Why are we seemingly so stuck on alternative and diverse families and never get to counterkinship and deep difference? Why can't gay parents ever get laid (by the same sex they supposedly desire)? Most curiously perhaps, why are most of the parents we see in popular representations (with the exception of The Kids Are All Right) male even when the statistics tell us otherwise? Why are all (televisual, cinematic) parents so wonderfully ""accepting"" of their queer progeny even as we know queer kids are still getting kicked out of their homes in the ""real world"" of not so hip family life? An examination of contemporary representations in popular television and film reveals a complex combination of newly inclusive and potentially challenging images with tired and dangerous odes to a universalism that reasserts normative heterosexuality and further effaces feminist critiques of hegemonic family formations. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Family; feminism; film; kinship; media; sexuality",,"Walters, S.

These include the construction of the dangerous stranger as the primary threat to children; the widespread use of the terms 'paedophile' and 'child pornography' in the common lexicon and the placing of both the paedophile and pornography in virtual rather than real space. Such discourses not only fail to protect children, but may even work to fetishize youth and youthful bodies colluding with the widespread commercial sexualization of children. In the 'cyber-paed' the news media have created the monster of our age and orchestrated what some criminologists might term a moral panic about both 'cyber' and 'paeds'. This has occurred in a culture that, simultaneous with the castigation and outrage of the 'cyber-paed', routinely sexually objectifies children and infantilizes women to sell products, or pleasure as product; a culture that also largely ignores the evidence that most sexual crime against children happens in families.

Together, these factors have resulted in a heterosexual culture of intimacy with rigid public/private distinctions. Homonormativity has emerged with the rise of tongzhi (synonym for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered) space in Hong Kong since the 1990s, but has had the effect of marginalizing certain tongzhi along lines of class, age, and the body. Based on the narratives of 14 older (60+) gay men in Hong Kong, this article discusses how they have negotiated same-sex intimacy in everyday sites at two specific times - in their parents' homes and public toilets in the 1940s-1950s, when homosexuality was a crime and homosexual identity had not yet developed; and in their own homes and within the present-day tongzhi world, which presents them with new opportunities and challenges. Using a post-structuralist conception of power/resistance that juxtaposes power and resistance in the same site, this article argues that the private home and public spaces are sites of governmentality/resistance while tongzhi spaces are sites of desire/domination, with class and age being important social identifiers of Hong Kong gay men. Through radical use of spaces, a tongzhi heterotopia can be created and practised in both hetero-/homo-sexual worlds. This article contributes to the sociology of sexuality by exploring how governmentality via British colonialism (and post-colonialism), land use, and the family shape tongzhi bodies and space, exposing the domination of hetero-/homo-normativities in tongzhi lives, and highlighting tongzhi resistance in Hong Kong. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","'hetero'-/'homo'-normativity; Colonialism; Hong Kong; older gay men; public/private",,"Kong, T.

Both these discourses produced body norms in PE as male, abled and slender. However, how the teachers managed deviance and normalcy varies per discourse. 'Fat' bodies that were produced as deviant through the discourse of transformation were disciplined in explicit ways.

In fact, scholars have recently argued that motherhood may actually serve as a positive turning point in the lives of young women. Using a sample of young African-American women, this study assesses the degree to which teen motherhood not only affects college aspirations but also expectations. Further, it tests the ability of these effects to explain the well-known educational attainment gap between teen mothers and their non-childbearing peers.

Five studies investigated prescription for men of protective paternalism, a particular form of benevolent sexism, depending on contextual and individual factors. In Studies 1 and 2, female participants prescribed for men more protective paternalistic behavior toward women in a romantic than in a work context. In Study 3, male participants prescribed the same level of protective paternalistic behavior as female participants did. Conversely, more gender egalitarianism was prescribed for men in a work than in a romantic context (Studies 1-3). In Study 4, the same protective paternalistic behavior was labeled as intimacy in a romantic context but was identified to the same extent as intimacy and as sexism in a work context. In Study 5, female participants' benevolent sexist beliefs predicted their prescription of protective paternalistic behavior for men in both contexts. These studies demonstrated that prescription of protective paternalism for men is a complex phenomenon because it depends on contextual as well as individual variables.

The current study examines the relationship between the size of this ""face-ism"" bias (i.e., individual or micro-level sexism) and a number of gender inequality indicators (i.e., institutional or macro-level sexism) at the cross-cultural level. In one of the largest known face-ism databases to date, the authors used politicians' official online photographs as stimuli (N = 6,610) to explore how face-ism (as an example of individual-level sexism) covaries with institutional sexism across 25 cultures. The authors found that the face-ism bias was greater in cultures with lower levels of institutional gender inequality, demonstrating that institutional equality does not necessarily imply equality on the individual level. The authors offer a number of potential speculations for this mismatch. For example, it may be due to ""postfeminist"" backlash that occurs in response to decreases in level of institutional sexism or it may be due to different comparative processes that occur in more versus less gender-equal cultures. Implications for female politicians cross-culturally are discussed. The findings of our study provide empirical evidence to demonstrate how macro-level structural equalities could be related to individual and micro-level sexism, and how different levels of sexism might not necessarily be indicative of each other.

Women made aware of the dependency stereotype (compared to controls who were not) were less willing to seek help.

Utilizing grounded theory methodology as well as Black feminist thought and objectification theory as the research lenses, the results of this study uncovered how racist, sexist, and classist ideologies contributed to sexual objectification experiences (SOEs) among African American women. Twenty African American female graduate students and others recruited from a campus community participated in semistructured interviews. Data revealed a number of different sociocultural factors that contributed to the sexual objectification of African American women (i.e., historical influence of slavery, sexualized views and images of African American women, and patriarchal social structure). These factors were observed to contribute to different forms of sexual objectification, ranging from comments and objectifying gazes to more extreme forms, such as sexual abuse. Participants described a number of effects of sexual objectification, including self-objectification, physical safety anxiety, eating concerns, psychological/emotional, and interpersonal. Participants also described how they coped with and grew from these experiences. Psychologists and mental health professionals are encouraged to consider how African American women's SOEs are rooted in racism, sexism, and classism. Furthermore, these practitioners are urged to develop an awareness of how these oppressions intersect and contribute to the sexual objectification of African American women. © The Author(s) 2012.","body image; eating disorders; feminism; objectification theory; racial and ethnic groups; racism; safety; sexism; social class",,"Watson, L.

But despite its negative consequences, benevolent sexism is a prevalent ideology that some even find attractive. To better understand why women and men alike might be motivated to adopt benevolent sexism, the current study tested system justification theory's prediction that benevolent sexism might have a positive linkage to life satisfaction through increased diffuse system justification, or the sense that the status quo is fair. A structural equation model revealed that benevolent sexism was positively associated with diffuse system justification within a sample of 274 college women and 111 college men. Additionally, benevolent sexism was indirectly associated with life satisfaction for both women and men through diffuse system justification. In contrast, hostile sexism was not related to diffuse system justification or life satisfaction. The results imply that although benevolent sexism perpetuates inequality at the structural level, it might offer some benefits at the personal level. Thus, our findings reinforce the dangerous nature of benevolent sexism and emphasize the need for interventions to reduce its prevalence. © The Author(s) 2012.","ambivalent sexism; equity (social); life satisfaction; patriarchy; sexism; social issues; social justice; system justification",,"Connelly, K.; Department of Psychology, University of Florida, P.O.

The authors developed a mediational model to examine the degree to which gender differences in anxiety are explained by instrumentality and mastery while controlling for the influence of environmental stress and social desirability. Undergraduates (159 men and 239 women) completed an online questionnaire including measures of mastery, instrumentality, daily hassles, social desirability, and anxiety. Women reported significantly lower levels of instrumentality and mastery and higher levels of anxiety than men. Path analyses indicated that instrumentality and mastery were both significant mediators of the relationship between gender and anxiety after controlling for social desirability and hassles. The addition of a direct path from gender to anxiety was not significant and did not improve the fit of the model. These findings suggest that differences in gender socialization and mastery learning experiences for men and women help account for the female preponderance of anxiety. Interventions aimed at building instrumentality and mastery, particularly among girls, may help buffer against anxiety. © The Author(s) 2012.","anxiety; human sex differences; instrumentality; mastery; self-efficacy; socialization; stress",,"Chambless, D.

Using a computer-generated task, 80 undergraduate students from North-East England learned to navigate to a hidden goal. Activating the general navigation stereotype improved the performance of men, compared to the control condition, both when only geometric cues and only landmark cues were present (stereotype lift), suggesting that activating a general stereotype can affect tasks both with (geometry) and without (landmark) established gender-differences in preference. In addition, in the test trial (hidden goal removed) women who learned to navigate using only landmarks spent longer in the correct location of the hidden goal than those who learned to navigate using only geometry. In contrast, the opposite result was found for men, suggesting that when only one cue-type is available, gender-differences still occur, with women better able to navigate using landmarks than geometry, while men seemed to learn more about the location of the goal with reference to geometric than landmark cues. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender differences; Learning; Navigation; Stereotype lift; Stereotypes",,"Rosenthal, H.

We examined the effectiveness of experiential learning using the Workshop Activity for Gender Equity Simulation - Academic version (WAGES-Academic) to deliver gender inequity information. To assess whether the way gender inequity information is presented matters, we compared WAGES-Academic to an Information Only condition (knowledge without experiential learning) and a Group Activity control condition. We predicted that only the information presented in an experiential learning format (i. e., WAGES-Academic) would be retained because this information does not provoke reactance and instills self-efficacy. Participants (n=241; U. S. college students from a large mid-Atlantic state university) filled out a gender equity knowledge test at baseline, after the intervention, and then 7-11 days later (to assess knowledge retention). In addition, we measured feelings of reactance and self-efficacy after the intervention. Results revealed that participants in the WAGES condition retained more knowledge than the other conditions. Furthermore, the effect of WAGES vs. Information Only on knowledge was mediated by WAGES producing less reactance and greater feelings of self-efficacy.

A sample of 149 women aged 18 to 25 enrolled at a large southwestern U. S. university completed a series of survey instruments aimed at gaining knowledge of how several potentially pressure-filled domains of women's college environment (i. e., Body Image, Romance, Peers, Academics) may factor into a relationship between Silencing and Distress. Path analysis revealed that Silencing was directly, positively related to each source of pressure with the exception of Academic Engagement (where a negative relationship existed). Furthermore, Silencing was directly, positively related to Anxiety and Depression. Additionally, internalization of the thin ideal and competitiveness were predictive of distress among women who Present Perfection, or strive to appear perfect to others. Cluster analyses revealed 4 interpretable clusters of factors related to distress: Middle-of-the-Road, Moderately Appearance Focused, Other-Focused, and Reject Appearance Norms. The Other-Focused women showed the highest levels of distress and lowest academic engagement while those who Reject Appearance Norms showed the lowest distress and highest academic engagement. These relationships indicated that higher levels of attempting to appear perfect to others were related to higher levels of distress among US college women in our sample. This study points to a factor ""Presenting Perfection"" that may be instrumental in understanding self-silencing behaviors in college women, as well as further understanding the relation between body image, orientation toward others' judgments, and distress. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Body image; College; Distress; Image management; Perfection; Silencing; Women",,"Schrick, B.

This study has attempted to unravel the relations among gender, personality, and students' subject choices. The study was based on a sample of 1,740 9th grade pre-university students throughout the Netherlands (average age 15 years). We used the Five-Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI) of Hendriks, Hofstee, and De Raad (1999a) to measure the students' personalities. The research questions were: (1) To what extent are students' personality characteristics related to their subject choices in secondary education? (2) Do students' personality characteristics mediate the gender - subject choice relation? And if yes, which personality characteristics are responsible for this? (3) Is the relation between personality characteristics and subject choices different for boys and girls? We found several associations between personality characteristics and students' subject choices. Although the relationship between gender and students' subject choices was slightly attenuated after the inclusion of the personality characteristics in the multinomial logistic regression analyses, gender remained an important predictor of the students' choices. The personality factor Extraversion partially mediated the relation between gender and students' choice of advanced mathematics, chemistry, and physics versus a more language and culturally-oriented set of school subjects. Furthermore, gender was found to moderate the relation between the personality factor Autonomy and students' choice of advanced mathematics, chemistry, and physics versus a more language and culturally-oriented set of school courses. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Gender differences; Mediation; Moderation; Personality; Secondary education; Subject choices; Vocational interests",,"Korpershoek, H.; GION - Institute for Educational Research, University of Groningen, Grote Rozenstraat 3, 9712 TG, Groningen, Netherlands; email: h.korpershoek@rug.nl",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870296902

In this study, 485 U.

The provided scenarios depicted statutory rape situations, characterized by age discrepancies between the two parties. Respondents were asked to rate each of the parties on a series of questions to determine their level of condemnation for each of the parties involved. We hypothesized the existence of a sexual double standard, such that female actors would be more condemned than males. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that respondents were more condemning of female than male victims, regardless of which act was depicted. Furthermore, male respondents were more condemning of a female perpetrator of statutory rape than of her male victim, and also more condemning of a female victim than of her male perpetrator, whereas female respondents did not differentiate between the victim and perpetrator, regardless of the depicted victim gender or sexual act. That is, whether she was depicted as the victim or perpetrator of the act, the female was more condemned than her male counterpart.

S. prescribing that men dominate women sexually. We draw on social dominance theory to examine whether women's and men's level of support for group-based hierarchy (i. e., social dominance orientation; SDO) helps explain gender-based power beliefs and dynamics in heterosexual relationships. We conducted a laboratory study at a Northeastern U. S. university among 357 women and 126 men undergraduates who reported being heterosexual and sexually active, testing three sets of hypotheses. First, as hypothesized, women endorsed SDO and the belief that men should dominate sexually less than men did. Second, as hypothesized, among women and men, SDO was positively correlated with the belief that men should dominate sexually, and negatively correlated with sexual self-efficacy (confidence in sexual situations) and number of female condoms (a woman-controlled source of protection) taken. Third, structural equation modeling, controlling for age, family income, number of sexual partners in the past month, and perceived HIV/AIDS risk, supported the hypothesis that among women and men, the belief that men should dominate sexually mediates SDO's association with sexual self-efficacy. The hypothesis that the belief that men should dominate sexually mediates SDO's association with number of female condoms taken was supported for women only. The hypothesis that sexual self-efficacy mediates SDO's association with number of female condoms taken was not supported. Results suggest SDO influences power beliefs and dynamics in heterosexual relationships.

The present research extended work primarily conducted in the United States by investigating implicit gender-STEM stereotypes-and their relation to performance-among female and male engineering and humanities students in Southern France. In study 1 (N=55), we tested whether implicit gender-math stereotypes-as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998)-would be weaker among female engineering students as compared to female humanities, male engineering and male humanities students. In study 2 (N=201), we tested whether this same results pattern would be observed with implicit gender-reasoning stereotypes (using a newly created IAT) and, in addition, whether implicit gender-reasoning stereotypes would be more strongly (and negatively) related to math grades for female humanities students as compared to the three other groups. Results showed that female engineering students held weaker implicit gender-math and gender-reasoning stereotypes than female humanities, male engineering and male humanities students. Moreover, implicit stereotyping was more negatively related to math grades for female humanities students than for the three other groups. Together, findings demonstrate that female engineering students hold weaker implicit gender-STEM stereotypes than other groups of students and, in addition, that these stereotypes are not necessarily negatively associated with math performance for all women.

The aim of the article is to examine the role of organised activities in facilitating choice and active ageing among care home residents. Findings from a study of ten care homes in South East England exemplify the conflict between government policy rhetoric and the reality of care home life. The indication is that the formality of the ""activities of daily living"" support procedures restricts residents' involvement in the organised social activities.Within the general provision of services, the organised ""social activities"" offered failed to meet the interest, cognitive and physical abilities of residents. The reality of ""choice"" is therefore questionable.

We undertook a re-analysis of 125 interviews with older people (aged 55-98) that explored their experiences of widowhood. In this article, we focus on those interviews in which participants described themselves as experiencing loneliness by the spontaneous use of terms such as ""lonely"", ""loneliness"" or ""lonesome"". Almost half of the participants (42%) described themselves in that way without any prompting from the interviewer. In terms of understanding and describing the meaning of loneliness, 50% explained loneliness in terms of absence of either their spouse, a physical presence in the house or people. One-third (34%) discussed loneliness in relation to time and place: night, weekends and home, and 4% described the emotional impact of loneliness. Fifteen per cent just said they were lonely without elaboration, assuming a common understanding of what loneliness means. Our findings suggest that widowed people's understanding and experience of loneliness resonates with the concept of ""emotional"" loneliness, resulting from the loss of significant social and emotional attachment. This has important implications for the types of interventions that may be appropriate for remediating loneliness in this group. © The Author.","Emotion; Later life; Loneliness; Time and place; Widowhood",,"Bennett, K.

The transgression of familial links, a consequence of a state of war, is a central motif of his tetralogy: such transgression may take the form, for example, of rape, incest, patricide and fratricide. The protagonists of Mouawad's plays, children of war, have inherited a genealogy of blood. The family is cursed: it symbolizes violence, a savage world, a primitive state. It is a monster, where promises of solidarity and fraternity are not kept. To escape the hell of the family-in-war and the weight of inheritance, the protagonists must find or create other kinds of interpersonal connections. And such connections exist in two modes: friendship and promises. These journeys towards the other, consubstantial with self-knowledge, allow broken connections to be reconstructed, and long-dead, long-forgotten people to be rediscovered and remembered. Such journeys are complex and diverse, but they allow new modes of understanding, forgiveness and, above all, of rebuilding communities.

Ambivalent relationships based on race (French whites vis-à-vis islanders 'of colour') and law (assimilationist statehood versus regional autonomy) continue to problematize Martinican society and polity. This is despite significant material gains (now in question as a result of looming austerity in the French economy) made in the half-century since Fanon's original diagnoses in Black Skin, White Masks (1952). Pierre Bourdieu's 'everyday life' methodology is joined to psychological analyses of Martinican behaviour to reveal schizophrenic tendencies in the mind and body politic. An overarching frame is the contrast between an externally sold image of island 'paradise' with a political and psychological reality fraught with frustration, anxiety, stress and contradiction.

It draws on masculinity theory to examine the process of asserting a gay identity in the context of a society where the existence of such an identity is often denied. It argues that there is little discursive space in which the protagonist can express a gay identity in the way 'gay' is understood in the West, and considers the difficulty in asserting such an identity in a cultural setting where there is such denial. The article contends that Une Mélancolie arabe questions the ontological security of understandings of homosexuality between men in Muslim-influenced countries, and asserts that the novel challenges the current gender order and attempts to forge a 'gay' identity. © 2012 Intellect Ltd.","Gay identity; Homosexuality; Masculinity; Moroccan literature; North Africa",,"Smith, S.C.; Department of Languages, Translation and Media, University of Swansea, Singleton Park, Swansea, SA2 8PP, United Kingdom; email: s.smith@swansea.ac.uk",,,13682679,,,,"English","Int.

These accounts were gathered from interviews with human resources (HR) and hiring managers in 18 organizations (12 private, and six public, sector). Findings - These refer to two specific recruitment initiatives introduced with the assumption that these would enable organizations to build a more gender diverse workforce: revisiting job requirements to make them more appealing/accessible to women and the adoption of competency frameworks, assumed to be gender neutral. Practical implications - In providing further insights into the limitations of diversity business case/best practice change, supported by accounts of organizational practices drawn from a specific industry sector, it is hoped that this will provide a reflective lens for those in positions to influence policies aimed at addressing issues of gender inequality.

Design/methodology/approach - Semi-structured interviews with older female employees, who had non-linear careers, were conducted. The qualitative analysis of women's biographical narratives was achieved through adopting a socio-biographical approach. The subjective view of success in the non-linear careers was addressed. Findings - All respondents would have preferred a linear career. However a non-linear career is accepted as a possibility to follow one's own professional interests and to cope with professional insecurity. Moreover women discover strategies to cope with insecurity, organizational injustice or life course stereotypes, such as networking, additional qualifications, and making the change over to a self-employed position. Research limitations/implications - As all interviews were conducted with German professionals and a small qualitative sample, the results need an adaptation for other countries, younger generations and different social strata. Social implications - The need for social political concepts for non-linear careers became evident. The risk of the non-linear careers should be pooled between individuals and organizations. Originality/value - The study found that some decisions, which aim to avoid professional insecurity (e.g. additional qualification), produce non-linearity and hence increase the insecurity.

It seeks to contextualise issues around diversity within the current political environment, and identify the barriers to diversity in the NHS. The business case has been very strongly argued as justification for introducing both managing diversity and equal opportunity initiatives - here the paper examines the inconsistencies of using that argument, and maintains that the only justification worth presenting is that based on (deontological) moral arguments. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is conceptual in nature exploring the respective cases for diversity using a broad range of the available literature brought together as part of a rapid evidence assessment. It does so in order to make some far-reaching claims about the future justifications for active diversification of senior management in key public sector institutions. Findings - The distinctions between the business and moral cases are false, in that both have ethical reference points. However, the business case is not only difficult to translate to public sector institutions; there are also evidential problems with its adoption. In light of this the conclusion here is that the moral (deontological) case is the only one that has any long term value for proponents of diversity. Originality/value - The value of this paper is that it examines the confusion that surrounds different cases for advancing diversity as a policy aim and presents a clear delineation of them. It also draws out some of the - perhaps deliberate - blurring of the cases and underlines the huge problems with this all too common approach. Ultimately, it suggests that morality (deontological) arguments have most purchase in public sector organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Discrimination; Diversification; Employment legislation; Equal opportunities; Ethnic minorities; Health services; National Health Service; United Kingdom",,"Johns, N.; School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom; email: JohnsNR@cardiff.ac.uk",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

The purpose of this paper is to posit that leadership is an important factor for maintaining high group performance and morale under conditions of conflict. Specifically, the paper argues that leader conflict management, emotion management, and transformational behaviors determine the impact of conflict on group outcomes. Data were collected from 585 people in 89 workgroups from eight public service organizations in Australia. The authors used hierarchical regression to test the hypotheses regarding group performance and morale. To test mediation and moderation, the authors followed the procedure outlined by Baron and Kenny. Finally, they used the formulas provided by Preacher, Rucker and Hayes to test for moderated mediation. Results showed that diversity increased task conflict but was unrelated to relationship conflict. Both task and relationship conflict were negatively associated with group performance and morale, and effective leadership reduced these negative effects to zero. There was also a partial support for the authors’ theoretical model predicting that leadership moderates the indirect effect of diversity on group outcomes occurring through the mediator of conflict. A greater amount of variation in the diversity of work groups included in the sample would have been useful for overcoming problems of restriction of range, which likely reduced ability to observe an association between diversity and group outcomes. Based on the results, in order to prevent negative emotions from task and relationship conflict from damaging group performance, leaders of diverse groups can act to manage those emotions among their group members. Results from this study implicate conflict management training. While training for conflict management is beyond the scope of this research, further research should examine this issue. The study extends research in the area of diversity, leadership and group work. In particular, it demonstrates that transformational leadership is an important factor for maintaining high group performance and morale under conditions of conflict. It also offers practical assistance to individuals entrusted with the responsibility of managing culturally diverse workgroups. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Conflict; Diversity; Emotions; Leadership; Performance management",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Interviews with 21 female creatives provided insights into reasons for underrepresentation. Inductive coding was used to allow themes and categories to emerge from the data. A social constructionist interpretation was used. Since both gender and creativity are socially constructed, doing gender in the masculine creative department impeded progress and job satisfaction for women. Because women were held accountable both to the norms of the masculine field and to the norms of femininity, their performance suffered as they tried to succeed in an inequitable system. This paper examines how being a woman operating within a masculine paradigm might be especially difficult in creative fields. Because creativity is constructed based on mostly male gatekeepers using masculinity as a model, women are devalued and unable to influence the field of gatekeepers. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Advertising agency; Creative industries; Creativity; Doing gender; Gender",,,,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868018267

The narrator of her novel Abeng recounts the vast swaths of history that the novel's Jamaican characters ""did not know... they did not know... ""; its sequel, No Telephone to Heaven, portrays the violence that erupts at the site of willfully forgotten histories of slavery and colonialism; and Free Enterprise is Cliff's ghostwritten recovery of the long-silenced story of 19th-century abolitionist and entrepreneur Mary Ellen Pleasant from the burial zone of American historiography. Moreover, silence is built into Cliff's aesthetic as well, for she often represents absence mimetically, in fragmented prose that marks out on the page the spaces of forgetting. This is true of her short stories in the volume, The Store of A Million Items. Although Cliff's novels have received critical attention, her stories remain understudied yet they have much to tell us about the process of transforming silence-not into speech per se, for Cliff often preserves absent material as such, as though to memorialize its loss-but into a critical aesthetic. This article presents the aesthetic of silence in a cluster of Cliff's stories about racism, history, memory, and queer love, and examines her poetic resistance to the violence of silence as she charts, interrogates, and transforms it through writing. © 2012 The Author.",,,"Johnson, E.L.; Wagner CollegeUnited States; email: Erica.johnson@wagner.edu",,,17541476,,,,"English","Contemp.

Statehood should realize a hybrid space where center and ec-center, English and Spanish, old wealth and new enterprise, men and women, coexist in differentiated complementarity.

The article focuses on a holistic approach facilitated by the feminist concept of 'intersectionality', which is illustrated via a case study of Sightsavers' Lady Health Workers Programme in Pakistan.

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with 40 BAME women small business owners based in North West England. The main aims and objectives of the study were to: investigate the discriminatory experiences of BAME women small business owners related to the intersection between their gender and ethnicity, and to identify the forms (formal and informal) and types (emotional/instrumental) of social support available in relation to their entrepreneurial activities that enabled them to cope with and overcome, the discrimination they may encounter. Findings: The degree of discrimination experienced was reported as a result of gender, ethnic background or an intersection between both. This was attributed to a number of factors, including stereotypical difficulties in accessing different types of formal social support, e.g. formal business and financial support. Informal support by respondents' families was reported as a key source of both emotional and instrumental support. Research limitations/implications: This paper is just a starting point for this area of research and, because the sample covers women from a variety of BAME backgrounds, it is not possible to generalise the findings to the wider population of BAME women. However, it does give an indication of what issues need to be considered in the provision of instrumental support for BAME women small business owners. Practical implications: The paper shows that a key element in the development of a strategy for addressing the needs of the BAME women small business owners is the necessity to appropriately re-design mainstream business support systems and financial services, in order to provide these women effective access to formal social support. Originality/value: The experiences of BAME women small business owners have received little attention and this paper offers a unique insight into the relationship between how the intersection between gender and ethnicity impact on experiences of discrimination and social support. Whilst it highlights many intra group differences, it has also demonstrated the lack of homogeneity between and within women from different ethnic backgrounds. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Black Asian and minority ethnic; Discrimination; Ethnic groups; Ethnic minorities; Gender; Intersectionality; Small business owners; Social support; United Kingdom",,"Fielden, S.; Manchester Business School, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; email: sandra.fielden@mbs.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868030506

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 800 participants completed an online survey, with 546 completing a second survey one week later. Recommended scale development procedures were utilized throughout in order to design and test the proposed instrument. Findings: Item analyses determined a final set of most effective items, while exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided support for the eight-item, two-dimensional (female stereotypes, male stereotypes) scale (Gender Role Stereotypes Scale - GRSS). Additionally, internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities were acceptable, as was the construct-related validity. This study also finds that gender role stereotypes are best examined as a two-factor construct (male, female), rather than conceptualized as two poles of a unidimensional continuum. Practical implications: The GRSS has advantages over similar measures, including that it assesses attitudes toward both men and women with only eight items, and includes items that are easily understandable, cross-culturally appropriate, and modern. Practitioners can use the GRSS to assess potential gender role stereotypes held by management. If managers are found to have highly traditional gender role stereotypes, organizations may be able to intervene before stereotypes affect performance ratings or task assignments. Originality/value: This paper yields an updated and sound measurement scale to replace outdated scales assessing similar constructs and/or assessing only one gender role stereotype (male or female, versus both). The GRSS allows for the parsimonious, comprehensive, and effective measurement of gender role stereotypes in research and practice alike. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Gender; Gender roles; Gender stereotypes; Measurement; Scale development; Validation",,"Mills, M.

The results indicate that self-efficacy is a strong predictor of family interfering with work (FIW) and work interfering with family (WIF). Gender moderates the relation between supervisor support and WIF moderates the impact of efficacy beliefs and instrumental support at home on FIW. Specifically, while supervisor support is negatively related to WIF in women and men, high levels of support more strongly affected men's perceptions of WIF. In low self-efficacy men, high levels of support at home improved their perceptions of FIW but these perceptions worsened in women. These findings contrast with earlier research that focus predominantly on the predictive value of structural demands (for example, the number of hours worked per week and family size). This study shows that gender plays a critical yet intricate role as a predictor of the successful management of work and family roles: it is not gender per se but its interaction with personal and social variables that informs us about differences in the experience of employed parents. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Gender; Role conflict; Self-efficacy; Social support","family structure; gender relations; gender role; perception; statistical analysis","Chiocchio, F.; Department of Psychology, Université de Montréal, C.P. 6128, Succursale Centre-Ville, Montreal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada; email: f.chiocchio@umontreal.ca",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867989306

It focuses on the dimensions of military masculinities that can be distinguished as distinctive in practice. Drawing on Etienne Wenger's notion of communities of practice, this research asks how military men orient themselves in their social and material world, considering the role of practice in the development of military masculinities. A total of 71 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 53 male and 18 female personnel of various ranks working in the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force. Six focus groups were also carried out (with a total of 10 male and six female participants). Thematic analyses of the narratives indicated that one outcome of militarization is the construction of military masculinities. The military reframes masculinities as a means of meeting the aims of the process of militarization. Dimensions of military masculinities can be distinguished as attributes and qualities and masculinities that are distinctive to the military are constructed through military practice. A strong sense of belonging to the military community of practice is fundamental to the development of military masculinities. In order to feel that one belongs, the recognition and acceptance of others is needed. Those who share the attributes and comply with the practices peculiar to the military achieve this recognition. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Communities of practice; Culture; Identities; Military masculinities; Military organization","cultural identity; military application; organizational framework","Hale, H.C.; Psychology Department, University of Derby, Kedleston Road, Derby, DE22 1GB, United Kingdom; email: h.hale@derby.ac.uk",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867990007

Further, the study explores the ways in which the quality of the leader-follower relationship is revealed during the narration process. The research draws on five individual stories, collected in two rounds of interviews. Representations of several kinds of discriminatory practices can be found in the narratives and reveal that even being a partner in a good-quality leader-follower relationship does not necessarily protect a woman from pregnancy-related discrimination. However, women involved in a high-quality leader-follower relationship described their perceptions in a more positive manner than those in a low-quality relationship. The contribution of the article to the literature is twofold: firstly, the results challenge the traditional view that high-quality leader-member exchange relationships lead to positive outcomes. Secondly, examining the different ways in which people describe their perceptions of discrimination deepens our understanding of the equality problems that working women face. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Discrimination; Leadership; Narrative approach; Pregnancy","maternal care; perception; pregnancy; working conditions","Mäkelä, L.; University of Vaasa, Department of Management, P.O.

This article focuses on the role of discourse in reflecting and reproducing the absence of women in the construction trades. A small excerpt from an industry report is described, interpreted and explained using critical discourse analysis. The analysis takes as its starting point one phrase, 'most jobs in the construction industry can be done by women' and places it in its structural, institutional and historic context, showing its dependence on presuppositions about women's abilities, and the ideological basis of those assumptions. Male construction workers' masculine identity is defined in relation to their 'tough' job. The culture of taking safety risks, and working long hours in primitive working conditions suits some employers very well. The report's assertion that women can do 'most jobs' in construction appears to challenge the dominant ideology but it actually reproduces it, helping to maintain gender segregation. Thus it contributes in a small way to sustaining existing power relations by containing potentially transformative movements. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Building trades; Construction culture; Discourse; Masculinity; Women","construction industry; gender disparity; gender relations; ideology; womens employment; womens status; working conditions; United Kingdom","Ness, K.; University of Reading, School of Construction Management and Engineering, Whiteknights, P.O.

We find that among women who intended to return to work (who constitute the majority), most planned to pursue alternative careers, typically in traditionally female-dominated professions or were uncertain about their career direction; few planned to return to their former employers. The reasons for this redirection were women's negative experiences in family inflexible occupations, skill depreciation and perceived age discrimination. Equally or more important, however, was their adaptation to new constraints and opportunities at home (such as increased involvement in mothering and community work), which engendered an aspirational shift towards new, care-oriented professions that were lower paid and had lower status.

The pervasiveness of enterprise culture has led to observations that it influences aspects of social life beyond the workplace. However, the kind of self that is imagined in enterprise culture is also a male self, with female entrepreneurship measured against a male norm.

Rather, they present an empowering vindication of womanhood in the act of expelling new life from the depths of woman's body-precisely where post-coital conception and development take place. The ""maternal"", then, as an aestheticist term, includes not only gestation, delivery of the child and mothering, but also the sexual act and physiological process of conception. This expansive and connotative sense of the maternal is increasingly evident in nineteenth-century poetry that redefines aesthetic ""beauty"" and resituates the parameters of the ideal during the course of the century, thereby contributing to the discourse of aestheticism concerned with the socio-political and cultural implications of the pregnant woman as a symbol of human continuity. Therefore, it is not surprising that in depicting the maternal as a series of aestheticist moments of specifically female human experience, women poets depict women weaving themselves into the fabric of an altered society. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Rigg, P.; Department of English and Theatre, Acadia University, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada; email: patricia.rigg@acadiau.ca",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871449455

Nevertheless, while Smith's hero D'Alonville is a banished French aristocrat with a deep sense of nationalism, his struggles during the Revolution alter his resolve against the revolutionaries' ideals, and his exposure to other brands of political thought gradually convert him from an aristocrat of the Ancien Régime into a citizen of a new, more modern world. The significance of this conversion is illuminated when compared to a similar one in the hero of Mary Robinson's 1796 Hubert de Sevrac, a novel packed with conventional Gothic characteristics, yet one much more ostensibly reformist in its objectives than Smith's novel. Reading these two novels side by side clarifies how both Smith and Robinson use their émigré heroes to model for the reader how the aristocrat can be converted to an appreciation of the ""new order of things"". More importantly, in each of these novels, the authors take a woman's perspective in pointing out the moral implications of oppression and bloodshed, whatever the cause. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Markley, A.A.; Penn State BrandywineUnited States",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871414877

With each sonnet faced on the page by a short prose extract from the work of prominent contemporary historians of the Anglo-Saxon period, such as Sharon Turner and Francis Palgrave, or from early nineteenth-century translations of Anglo-Saxon texts, Hawkshaw draws attention to the practice of popular nineteenth-century historiography. Through the sonnets that follow, Hawkshaw reworks the conventional historical narrative by way of a more intimate and personalized perspective. By moving away from both the masculine historical narrative and the genre of historical biography made popular by female historians of the Anglo-Saxon period, such as Hannah Lawrance and Mrs Matthew Hall, Hawkshaw finds freedom in the imaginative space of the sonnet to give Anglo-Saxon women a voice.

Wood's heroine, Isabel Vane, suffers serious injustices at the hands of men who are, in one way or another, her family. Although her husband, Archibald Carlyle, is often read as a modern, bourgeois hero, he does not behave that differently from the rogues around him. However, the women in East Lynne are presented as dynamic individuals, who are active, authoritative property owners. In fact, the heroine's economic dependence on her husband is underlined as the ultimate source of their family conflict. Thinking of the family in terms of property, commodification and ownership is a corrective to the sentimentalization of family in much Victorian literature, and the focus on Wood, in particular-who was one of the most popular and prolific writers of the century-demonstrates that even a reputedly conservative supporter of ""traditional morality"" could discern the ways in which the Victorian family served, most often, to disempower and disenfranchise women. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Simpson, V.; Department of English, University of New Brunswick, PO Box 4400, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada; email: vsimpson@gmail.com",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871419599

In this article, the friendship between Burney and the young actress is set centre stage and its importance in the formative years of the writer's professionalism is explored. Barsanti set out in her own professional life during the years leading up to Burney's composition and publication of Evelina (1778). Her situation thus had personal resonance for a young woman whose family was so involved in the world of creative professionalism, and who was contemplating creative work of her own. Burney's interest in and attitudes towards Barsanti in her journals and letters demonstrate the nature of her investment in the possibility that the ""prudish"" version of feminine propriety she favoured could coexist with a theatrical career.

For some women, urban London became a location wherein one could unburden oneself from the limitations of home life. However, Evelyn Sharp's short stories contributed to a strain of New Woman fiction that investigated the personal costs of the adoption of a profession. To choose a career did not simply change what a woman did with her time; it altered her identity. The classed bodies of career women were often identified and read through the occupations they practiced. When Evelyn Sharp's heroines masquerade as a shop girl and an artist's model in order to free themselves from bourgeois social norms, the way men respond exposes how expectations regarding gender and class status continue to constrict their professional and personal choices. ""In Dull Brown"" and ""The Other Anna"", published in the controversial periodical the Yellow Book, dramatize the plight of New Women who desire socio-economic independence as well as equality in their personal relationships. Despite the increased liberty garnered when one adopts a career, these women ultimately discover that their professional personas permit only a limited sense of freedom. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Krueger, K.; Arkansas State UniversityUnited States",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871432774

Indeed, some mothers engage in transnational cultural currency speculation of cultural resources by converting the educational investment in their children into educational credentials in the national setting where they expect the highest returns.

The article illuminates what the serial migrants viewed as contradictory everyday practices that produced 'non-shared environments'. It discusses three ways in which transnationalism appeared to be a central part of the serial migrants' family lives. First, it was embodied. Second, it was lived as cultural difference between Caribbean-born and UK-born siblings. Third, it was reported to be evident in parental practices.

The arguments advanced in this article are based on a multi-method qualitative research project focusing on transnational cooperation in the planning and realization of LGBTQ protest events in Poland, conducted in the years 2008-2009. The authors highlight the decisively coalitional nature of the activist networks around LGBTQ politics in some of the locations studied. They argue that feminists are core actors in these 'networked solidarities' around the oppression and marginalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer and transgender people both in local and transnational contexts. Solidarity is a concept used by many research participants to account for their political actions and to rationalize intra- and intergroup dynamics shaped by complex webs of differences. The authors draw on postcolonial feminist discussions on the limits and potentialities of politics of solidarity as a 'politics of location' to account for tensions which some activists reported regarding their experience of 'coalition work'. Some of these tensions related to gender politics and gender relations, always articulated in the conjunction of wider webs of power relations. © The Author(s) 2012.","Bisexual; European Union; feminism; gay; lesbian; Poland; solidarity; transgender and queer politics; transnational activism",,"Binnie, J.; Manchester Metropolitan University, Geography and Environmental Management, All Saints University Campus, All Saints, Manchester, M15 6BH, United Kingdom; email: j.binnie@mmu.ac.uk",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Conversely, arguments focusing on the continuing importance of state-bounded social citizenship rights undermine such postnationalist claims. To assess these claims, this article turns to the Irish state and its prohibition of abortion except in cases where the life of the pregnant woman is in danger. The authors focus their analysis on four legal cases that unfolded between 1992 and 2010. These cases reflect how specific women's social location within interconnected power hierarchies of nationality, gender, class, race/ethnicity positioned them differently vis-a-vis the Irish state, international (European Court of Human Rights) and supranational (EU) bodies. Furthermore, the transnational, in the form of immigration, non-governmental organizations and the Catholic Church, plays an important role in structuring the context within which these cases unfold. Rather than showing that the international, supranational and transnational are conduits for the declining power of the nation-state, this article finds that in the increasingly dense legal-political field there is room for all of these forces. © The Author(s) 2012.","Abortion; EU; gender; international human rights law; intersectionality; public/private",,"García-del Moral, P.; University of Toronto - Sociology, 725 Spadina Avenue, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada; email: p.garciadelmoral@utoronto.ca",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Still little is known about families that fail to operate transnationally and are broken by the migration experience. For instance, when can we say that this type of family cannot be sustained?

The case study draws a comparison between younger and older generations of Chechen women in Austria, Poland and Germany and their radically different gender practices. The analysis shows that the turn towards more conservative gender relations, which can be observed among the younger generation, cannot be explained by a reference to the Chechen culture as inherently patriarchal. Nor can it be ascribed solely to the insufficient reception and the lack of recognition experienced by refugees in the receiving countries. Rather, it is an outcome of women's different conditions of socialization that have affected their hierarchy of values and continue to exert significant influence on their adaptation strategies in exile; most notably, on how the women perceive and make use of the opportunity structures in the receiving contexts. © The Author(s) 2012.","Chechnya; gender practices; intergenerational differences; refugee adaptation; transnational space",,"Szczepanikova, A.; Institut f̈r Gesellschafts-und Politikanalyse, Goethe-Universität, Robert Mayer-Str. 5, 60054 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; email: alice.szczepanikova@gmail.com",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Reports of civilian casualties are, however, frequently dismissed as being examples of Taliban propaganda or blamed on the actions of enemy fighters, while the tragic loss of civilians is rarely marked or even acknowledged within the dominant frames of war. At first glance, the fact that civilians are so easily expendable appears to be at odds with the humanitarian intentions underpinning the war. However, I argue that the rhetoric of humanitarianism operates to preclude Afghans from appearing as recognizable human beings, foreclosing the possibility that they possess a life worthy of protection. Drawing on the work of Judith Butler, I will trace the ways in which Afghans have been reduced to the status of absolute victims, denied the very essence of their humanity and therefore a publically grievable death. By effectively constructing them as the living-dead, existing in a state of abeyance, Afghans have been exposed to a deathly logic in which their lives are expendable in the quest to make them liveable once again. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Afghanistan; Civilian casualties; Grief; Judith Butler; Normative violence; Politics of intelligibility",,"Gregory, T.; Department of Politics, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, United Kingdom; email: thomas.gregory@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

This study addresses the question of what happens when feminist knowledge is incorporated into the discourse of security institutions. It draws on Michel Foucault's concept of governmentality to examine the contingent encounters of feminist discourses with the liberal peace paradigm and traditional conceptions of security in the context of United Nations multidimensional peacekeeping operations over the period 1999-2010. Throughout these encounters, political rationalities of peacekeeping tend to subjugate feminist objectives to the broader goal of conflict resolution. Simultaneously, feminists and women's rights activists who engage with mainstream peacekeeping rationalities are turning into potentially influential 'gender experts', who contest and redefine traditional meanings of peace and security. As bureaucratic machineries become involved in the collection of data on post-conflict gender dynamics, such as violence against women and girls, women's formal political participation and acts of sexual violence committed by peacekeepers, feminist knowledge increasingly informs technologies of population management in post-conflict settings. In the process, certain gendered and racialized identities are normalized, and certain rationales for military intervention in the post-colonial world are put forward, thus contributing to creating new marginalities and consolidating existing ones. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Gender mainstreaming; Governmentality; Peacekeeping; Power/knowledge; United Nations",,"Reeves, A.; School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies, University of Bristol, 4 Priory Road, Bristol, BS8 1TY, United Kingdom; email: audrey.reeves@bristol.ac.uk",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

The article demonstrates how partnerships assert their legitimacy through a proposed mutually supporting relationship between women's empowerment and companies' economic gains, in contrast to a human rights-based approach to development. I show how UN-business partnerships for women's empowerment mobilize discourses, policies and governmental techniques to create alignments between business objectives and individual women's empowerment. Each woman is constituted as an ally of economic success by pursuing her education, increasing productivity and entrepreneurship. I argue that public-private partnerships for women's empowerment do not challenge the gendered structures of the global economy, though they may improve individual women's economic situation in the short term.

This article explores the 2010 Afghan Parliamentary campaign of Farkhunda Zahra Naderi, who uses the symbol of the burqa rather than her own face on her campaign posters. Naderi's campaign represents a disruption of the purported essence of the burqa because it denaturalizes the garment, purporting to turn the little window into a 'window of power'. Naderi removes herself from her position of power as an educated Afghan woman with access to many opportunities and instead places the spotlight on the faceless Afghan woman in the burqa, symbolizing that it could be any woman on that campaign poster; it could be any Afghan woman running for office. This is her goal: to enable any woman to be successful, in the burqa or not, able to make the choice not to wear the burqa, but also to make the choice to wear the burqa but not be subjugated as a result. In this way the notion that there is any essence to the burqa itself is disrupted. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Afghanistan; Burqa; Election; Farkhunda Zahra Naderi; Women's rights",,"Auchter, J.; School of Politics and Global Studies, Arizona State University, Box 873902, Tempe, AZ, 85287, United States; email: jessica.auchter@asu.edu",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

Significant gender differences in pornography exposure, perceived realism of pornographic contents and attitudes towards recreational sex were found. No direct relationship was found between adolescent exposure to pornography and relationship intimacy in young adulthood. As hypothesised, the realism of pornography was related both to exposure and intimacy, but only among female participants. Furthermore, the association between the appraisal of pornographic realism and intimacy was shown to be mediated by attitudes towards recreational sex.

Past studies have predominantly concentrated on the potential negative influences of peer norms on risky sexual behaviours, but they have seldom investigated the underlying processes behind such influences. This study explored the direct associations between adolescent sexual activity and friends' support, levels of disagreement with friends and friends' modelling for sexual activity. We also investigated the potential mediating role of the perception of peer influence for sexual activity and of the perception of being too young to have initiated sexual activity among these associations. This study was conducted among 328 Italian adolescents (56% female; 30% sexually active; aged 15-19 years; mean age = 16.23 years) using a two-wave longitudinal design. Linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that level of disagreement with friends and sex activity modelling by friends were both positively associated with the presence of sexual activity. Additionally, the perception of being too young to have initiated sexual activity fully mediated the association between the level of disagreement with friends and the presence of sexual activity, and it partially mediated the association between the sexual activity modelling by friends and the presence of sexual activity. Finally, perceived peer influence partially mediated the association between sexual activity modelling by friends and the presence of sexual activity.

This article is an empirical and critical account of monogamous coupledom as a privileged relational experience. Data are drawn from 14 in-depth interviews with Australian men and women who self-identified their cross- or same-sex partnerships as sexually and emotionally monogamous. Monogamy, as participants construct it, is critiqued as an action and policy that produces an exclusive and contained essence of relationships and that guards against a perceived chaotic excess that is set-up in opposition to it. Such action is seen to impel a sense of mastery in relationships and selves that are properly enclosed, channelled and thereby ordered. The sociohistoric binary arrangement of an ordered inside and chaotic outside is focused on as enabling a superior monogamous order while also underpinning its precariousness and psychological frailty. Drawing on Deleuzian ideas about a non-privileged and non-hierarchical system of relating, an alternative way of intimately connecting with others is brought into theoretical view, one that does not favour contained and fixed essences as foundations for relationships, intimate connections and life. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Chaos; Containment; Couple relationship; Monogamy; Order; Plurality",,"Finn, M.; School of Psychology, University of East London, London, United Kingdom; email: m.finn@uel.ac.uk",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

As societies have developed, the social roles of, and the stereotypes attached to, men and women have also changed. We may, therefore, expect there to be a dynamic component of gender stereotyping that affects the perception of men and women in the past, present, and future. Although this evolution of stereotypes is fairly well developed in the literature, a replication in Spain is still missing and this study sought to address this gap. Two hundred and seventy-seven men and women (aged between 15 and 87 years old) from three regions of Spain (Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha, and Madrid) participated in this study. In line with social role prediction studies, this research shows that gender stereotypes in Spain include dynamic aspects and that the content of these stereotypes is rooted in social roles. In general, people perceived women's roles and stereotypes to be changing more quickly over time than those of men. Women were also perceived as taking on masculine-agency characteristics, in contrast to men, who were not perceived as taking on feminine-communal characteristics. Age was a strong moderator in several interactions. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Gender; Social role theory; Spain; Stereotypes",,"Lopez-Zafra, E.; Universidad de JaénSpain; email: elopez@ujaen.es",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

Masculinity can therefore be seen as 'bounded' since social norms constructed men as family breadwinners. On the other hand, femininity can be seen as 'unbounded' in that women were released from the pressure to assume a breadwinning role. This article draws on critical discursive psychology to investigate the subject positions that a group of Japanese men and women assume in relation to a 'bounded masculinity/unbounded femininity' interpretative repertoire during group interviews. Results of the analysis indicate that a majority of the participants assumed complicit subject positions in relation to these repertoires and in the process normalized a traditional gendered division of labour. Those participants who took up more resistant subject positions can be seen as contesting and potentially subverting unequal gender relations. The contribution these accounts make to reify or conceivably democratize gender relations is also considered. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Bounded masculinity/unbounded femininity; Critical discursive psychology; Ideological dilemma; Interpretative repertoire; Subject position",,"Charlebois, J.; Department of Global Culture and Communication, Aichi Shukutoku UniversityJapan; email: justinc@asu.aasa.ac.jp",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

Through her literary experiments, Stein explores the relationship of modernist abstraction and hermeticism to cultural stereotypes regarding male and female intelligence, as well as their elitist connection to high cultural capital. When Stein exaggerates these hermetic writing techniques, she criticizes the high modernist tendency to glorify male genius and marginalize women artists and intellectuals. When Stein creates a literary style that deliberately problematizes the reader's process of interpretation, she performs as a mind that is oblivious to linguistic and social conventions.

Since then, they have seen many of their demands translated into public policies favoring gender equity and reproductive rights. Some scholars argue that such policy changes have a limited impact on women's daily life in Latin America and it is necessary to conceptualize the outcomes of social movements more broadly to include their cultural and political effects as well as the links between these. Findings are presented from a study of two coalitions engaged in reproductive rights advocacy in Arequipa and Cusco, Peru. The approach for evaluating the materials included participant observation, focus group discussions and individual interviews with coalition members. The study found that coalition members perceive the effects of their advocacy on government policies in terms of five dimensions: coalition-government interactions, issue visibility and recognition, policy enactments, policy implementation, and policy position. I conclude that a broader definition of social movement outcomes is needed to evaluate efficacy and models for future action and that this should take into account the complexities of social and political change, particularly concerning reproductive rights and gender equity. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Advocacy; Outcomes; Peru; Policies; Reproductive rights; Social movements",,"Coe, A.-B.; Umeå Center for Gender Studies, University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden; email: anna-britt.coe@ucgs.umu.se",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

The focus of the program was to educate women in the group on a wide array of topics from negative sexual rights (e.g., the right to be protected from or ability to protect oneself from sexually transmitted infections) to positive sexual rights (e.g., the right to experience pleasure). The program was based on previous strengths-based educational formats and tools. Positive feedback from informants included the applicability, accessibility, and engaging format of the program.

Although immigration laws are based on the principle of family unification, under current federal law lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans cannot sponsor their same-sex foreign national partners for residency in the United States. Consequently, an estimated 36,000 couples face the threat of family separation because the narrow definition of ""family"" used by U.S. immigration services excludes same-sex binational couples and their children. Despite the fact that family research indicates that long periods of separation have harmful effects on the family, immigration law continues to deny binational families the basic right of family unity afforded many of their heterosexual counterparts. Bi-national couples must learn how to function in a social system while dealing with heterosexism, overt discrimination, violence, and the psychological symptoms that result from helplessness. This article will explore the ways in which nonheterosexual binational families must struggle to keep their families together as a result of the discriminatory ways in which laws are constructed in this country. We propose that discriminatory immigration policies have neglected contemporary family research that describes the family as a diverse array of intimate systems that provide mutual care. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","binational couples; discrimination; immigration policies; sexual prejudice; Uniting American Families Act",,"Domínguez, D.

These unique difficulties warrant the development of targeted interventions that can assist such families with the burdens of homophobia and racism. It is vital that clinicians engage fathers as they assist young black gay men and their families to resolve the clash between homosexuality and the male gender role expectations in their communities.

In these cases, judges must determine whether social parents possess legal parental rights and responsibilities. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to assess judges' rulings and justifications in 43 parental status cases involving gay disputants. The results verified a typology of five overarching legal themes, or rationales, that judges relied on in their decisions. The data also reveal that nearly half of the rulings in the sample were against conferring parental rights or responsibilities to social parents. These trends in judicial rulings call attention to potential adverse consequences for children's well-being, as prior research has linked disruptions in parent-child relationships to negative psychosocial outcomes.

This study explored focus groups of low-income mothers' experiences in these programs. Using grounded theory methodology, the authors examined both the impact of the programs, as well as how the participants' perspectives on marriage and relationships affected their experience. Findings suggest these women value marriage and healthy relationships, but their ideals often conflict with their experiences.

It explains long-term developments in Dutch LFP and concludes that the existing image of Dutch women's historically low participation in the labor market should be reconsidered. Contrary to what many economic historians have supposed, Dutch women's LFP was not lower, and was perhaps even higher, than elsewhere in the pre-1800 period. As in other Western European countries, the decline of (married) Dutch women's LFP only started in the nineteenth century, though it then probably declined faster than elsewhere. Thus, this study concludes that the Netherlands did not constitute the ""first male-breadwinner economy,"" as historians and economists have suggested. Scrutinizing the nineteenth-century data in more detail suggests that a complex of demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural changes resulted in this sharp decline of Dutch women's crude activity rates. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","economic development; household labor; Netherlands, 1600-1900; Women's labor force participation",,"Schmidt, A.; Leiden University - Institute for History, 2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; email: a.schmidt@hum.leidenuniv.nl",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

This contribution draws on historical research to challenge such an account. First, it demonstrates that the trough in participation is in part statistically manufactured by uncritical reliance on official sources that systematically undercount women workers. Second, it exploits nonstandard sources to construct alternative estimates of women's participation. Third, it analyzes the reconstructed rates to determine their congruence with neoclassical economics and modern empirical studies. Not all posited relationships time travel. Supply-side factors such as marital status and number and age of children are major determinants of modern women's decision to enter the labor force, yet appear less prominent in historical contexts. Instead, the demand for labor seems decisive. Finally, the U-shaped curve is not entirely a statistical artifact, but appears to evolve at higher levels of participation than usually suggested. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Economic development; economic growth; economic history; family wage; labor market inequality; women's labor force participation",,"Humphries, J.; All Souls College, Oxford OX1 4AL, United Kingdom; email: jane.humphries@all-souls.ox.ac.uk",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

This belief causes an immeasurable amount of strain and anxiety for lesbians because their feelings, desires, and emotions are considered ""unnatural"" and aberrant. The homophobic Islamic model of homosexuality thus celebrates heteronormative performances of gender and sexuality. In the present study, the issue of how religious identity interplays with sexual identity is examined. Using data gained from online interviews with five Muslim lesbians, the article considers whether the women are able to create their lesbian identity within a discourse that negates their sexual orientation. Their lives as Muslim lesbians produces a unique intersection where religion and sexuality converge, yet they are forced apart by religiously sanctioned homophobia, preventing them from exploring and expressing their sexuality. The article further examines whether Islam is a source upon which the women draw strength to understand their sexuality and to cope with being in the closet. Despite being members of Imaan, a Muslim LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) support group, the women continue to experience a significant degree of conflict.

This article concludes that, though women are identified in international discourses as essential contributors to sustainable mountain development, the social identity 'mountain women' has not yet evolved into a collective identity around which political solidarities and strategies coalesce to ultimately ground collective action. Indeed, women's organizations have other themes on their agendas and are active at other scales apart from the global one. Indeed, few are willing to identify themselves as 'mountain women.'

Gender imbalance in rural youth out-migration has prompted feminist researchers to consider more carefully linkages between the gendered nature of rural space and place and the social and spatial mobility of rural young men and women. Based on 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a rural Irish fishing community, this article explores the gendered dimensions of rural youth experience. Theoretically grounded in the conceptual triad of gender, power and place, this article considers how young men and women experience 'the rural' as masculine and feminine subjects. Special attention is given to the ways in which relations of power in 'the rural' are articulated, contested and accommodated in the everyday lives of local young men and women. As well as highlighting the ways in which rural space and place is male-dominated, this article foregrounds other power relations at play in the rural. As part of this effort, I problematize male power and point to the 'effectivity of girls as conduits of power'.

This paper examines Australian print media's representation of sex offenders, focussing particularly on the sex of the offenders and aiming to shed light on some of the misconceptions and deep-rooted prejudices within the population at large. Given the multi-faceted nature of sexual offences, this paper focuses on sexual offences committed by both males and females against minors in the context of a companion breach of duty of care. In order to explore the effect that linguistic tools can have in the Australian print media's way of reporting sexual abuse cases, twenty-nine newspaper articles published in Australian dailies were selected for analysis. The analysis of these articles reveals a marked bias in the manner in which sexual offences perpetrated by males, as opposed to females, are reported, suggesting a male monopoly on sexual abuse. We argue that this biased representation, which hinders adequate profiling of sexual offences against minors, may stem from an androcentric view of sexuality and from the systematic denial of female agency when it comes to sex. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Child sexual abuse; Duty of care; Female sex offenders; Media representation",,"Eisenchlas, S.

There seems to be a notion that once a woman has children she is first and foremost an example, and must be responsible and conservative in a culturally specific way. Most women become mothers at some point in their lives and this is a major physical, emotional, and role transition, one that many women struggle with privately given societal ideals of a ""good"" mother. Despite its essential role in motherhood and life, and the health benefits known to be associated with sexual activity, public expression of sexuality is still primarily associated with being young, childless, and unmarried. Using a social constructionist perspective, we look at the ways in which acceptable expressions of mothers' sexuality are defined and negotiated by contemporary women. Based on in-depth interviews with fifty women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, we discuss women's images of mothers' sexuality and the ways in which motherhood impacts women's experiences of sexuality. We find that for most mothers interviewed, the way they felt about sex, their sexual appeal, and their level of sexual desire changed after having children. Coupled with the fatigue and responsibility associated with being a new mother, women felt disconnected from their sexuality for a period of time. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC (outside the USA).","Media images of mothers; Motherhood; Role transition; Sexuality; Women's sexuality",,"Montemurro, B.; Division of Social Sciences, Penn State Abington, 1600 Woodland Road, Abington, PA 19001, United States; email: eam15@psu.edu",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

This study examined the constructions and experiences of reproductive and sexual health, and associated services, in Assyrian and Karen women who had arrived in Australia as refugees. Forty two women, across a range of age groups and marital status, participated in five focus groups, with thematic analysis and positioning theory used to analyse the results. Two major themes were identified. The first, the 'Premarital Chastity Imperative' centres on the cultural prohibition of coital hetero-sex before marriage, and taboos associated with same-sex relationships. This has implications for unmarried women's access to sexual health services, such as contraception, cervical screening, and abortion; prohibition of sex education and communication about sex; and lack of recognition of non-heterosexual identities. The second theme, 'Marital Sex and Reproductive Imperative', positioned coital sex and motherhood as mandatory within marriage, and was associated with women's inability to refuse marital sex, limited knowledge about contraception and sexual pain, acceptance of fertility services, as well as lack of recognition of post-natal depression. It is concluded that health care workers need to be aware of cultural constructions of sex and sexuality, as well as the construction of gendered roles within heterosexual relationships, when designing and offering sexual health services to non English speaking or migrant communities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Assyrian; Contraception; Culturally and linguistically diverse groups (CALD); Gendered roles; Karen; Pregnancy; Sexual and reproductive health; Sexual pain",,"Ussher, J.

For girls, this also applies if they assess the use within their peer group as particularly extensive, and for boys, if they frequently discuss pornography within their peer group.

The current study aims to build on the sparse literature on victimization of nonconforming women while rooting this vein of inquiry more firmly in dynamic sociocognitive models of interactive behavior. In the current study, 60 collegiate men participated in a sham aggression paradigm against a female confederate whose appearance was manipulated to exhibit either ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" characteristics. Aggression was measured in terms of frequency, intensity, and duration of electric shocks ostensibly administered by the participant to his fictional opponent. Results indicated that low masculine conforming men evinced higher levels of aggression against the feminine opponent than they did toward a masculine opponent. Findings are discussed in terms of the unique influence of the female gender role as it relates to variability in men's conformity to masculinity and risk of aggressive responding.

In accordance with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), men with higher levels of GRC also report negative attitudes and a lack of intentions to seek help for problems. Additionally, prior research regarding other individual and contextual help-seeking related variables has shown that men with higher GRC report increased stigma of both seeking help and having mental health problems, as well as greater concrete barriers to help-seeking. In this study, 176 undergraduate men were assessed for GRC, DM, and help-seeking-related variables including attitudes, intention to seek help, self-stigma of seeking help, self-stigma regarding mental health problems, and concrete barriers to seeking help. Results indicate that GRC is positively correlated with DM and negatively correlated with help-seeking variables. Mediation analyses suggest a relationship between DM, GRC, and help-seeking. Specifically, results demonstrate that GRC mediates the relationship between DM and intentions to seek help, thus explaining why men with body image concerns may be less likely to utilize treatment. In addition, self-stigma of seeking help and attitudes toward seeking help emerged as mediating factors between GRC and intentions to seek help. Intervention strategies aimed at increasing help-seeking behavior for men who suffer from body image concerns, and disordered eating and exercise behaviors, may benefit from targeting stigmatization and attitudes toward seeking help. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Attitudes; Drive for muscularity; Gender role conflict; Help-seeking; Men; Self-stigma; Theory of planned behavior",,"Shepherd, C.B.; Department of Psychology, Colorado State University, 1876 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1876, United States; email: caitlin.shepherd@colostate.edu",,,15249220,,,,"English","Psychol.

The months after completion of medical treatment may be unexpectedly difficult as a result of unrealistic expectations about a rapid return to life before cancer, especially for men who feel unprepared for their partners' transition from active treatment. We tested the hypotheses that men would report improved adjustment during this transition period, with men who felt well-prepared reporting better adjustment throughout. Participants were 164 male partners of women who had recently completed treatment for localized breast cancer and who had participated in the Moving Beyond Cancer clinical trial. Men completed questionnaires that assessed quality of life, mood, and cancer-related stress at approximately four and eight months after their partners finished primary treatment. In general, perceived preparedness interacted with time such that men who felt less well-prepared improved significantly over time whereas men who reported high preparedness experienced high levels of adjustment at both time points. Intrusive thoughts about cancer at the initial time point mediated the association between perceived preparedness and subsequent negative affect. These findings suggest that the patient's reentry period after treatment for breast cancer is a time of active adjustment for men who do not feel well-prepared for the challenges of this transition. © 2012 American Psychological Association.","Breast cancer; Cancer survivorship; Partners; Psychological adjustment; Quality of life",,"Meyerowitz, B.E.; Department of Psychology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-1061, United States; email: meyerow@usc.edu",,,15249220,,,,"English","Psychol.

The authors of the present article investigated characteristics of 1,913 young men and women with fixed and fluid sexual orientation recruited in an Internet-based study of sexual behavior in Sweden. One half of the respondents were students at a major Swedish university. Data indicated that women were twice as likely as men to report a fluid orientation. There were major differences between men and women, with maximal fluidity in the 25 to 34 age range, fluid women being more likely to be urban and not religious, and fluid men reporting higher education levels. Higher sexual partner numbers were associated with fluidity in women but fixedness in men. For both, living away from the family was associated with fluidity. These data suggest that fluidity is more prevalent in women, and that it may be associated not with an unformed sexual preference but with an expanding one in the midtwenties. Conceptualizing sexual orientation as fixed or fluid may be a useful alternative approach to conceptualization of sexual orientation as homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual; gender; homosexual; sexual orientation; sexual partner; theory",,"Ross, M.

In the model, analysis indicated that condom nonusers versus consistent users experienced more conversations with friends regarding salient topics (i.e., HIV status) (odds ratio [OR] =.86, p <.01) and fewer discussions with sexual partners about salient topics (OR =.77, p =.02). Furthermore, inconsistent condom users versus consistent users experienced higher levels of internalized homophobia (OR = 1.12, p =.04) and less racism associated with physical characteristics (OR =.89, p =.04). Notably, all of the racism dimensions identified in this research were nonsignificant as positive predictors of condom use. Overall, based on the findings, internalized homophobia may need to be isolated or targeted as an HIV-risk factor when implementing individual- and group-level HIV-prevention strategies for Black MSM. Moreover, improved communication skills among Black MSM pertaining to discussing salient topics (i.e., HIV status) with their sexual partners could also be used as a possible HIV-prevention strategy. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Black MSM; condom use; psychosocial dimensions",,"Smith, W.

However, recent polls and policy reversal have shown growing public support for homosexuals being allowed to serve openly. Interestingly, the amount of support has varied as a function of question wording. Two polls conducted by CBS News found support for homosexuals serving in the military varied with greater support for ""gays and lesbians"" compared to ""homosexuals."" Two studies were conducted to further examine the effect of terminology on reported support. Two samples reported opinions for homosexual civil rights issues. Sexual orientation was described using the terms gay men and lesbians, homosexuals, gay men, or lesbians. Percentage differences were found to be greater than those reported in the CBS polls, as wording choice had an effect on reported openness regarding homosexual civil rights. These differences indicate that it is important to consider precise terminology usage when measuring opinions. Levels of support, stereotypes activated, and the relationship between support for civil rights and general levels of prejudice were examined. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","civil rights; Don't Ask; Don't Tell; polling; public opinion; question wording; same-sex marriage; stereotypes",,"Nadler, J.

I argue that in the context of increasing opportunities for travel and technological innovations, North American masculine identities have become transnational, including for non-elite men. Sex tourists' descriptions of their experiences reveal that they are involved in a contradictory search for a masculine identity that is simultaneously progressive and hegemonic, one that relies not only on sex workers but also on a critique of the masculinity of Costa Rican men and other tourists. This article also suggests that sex tourism is best understood as a relational economy, in that the encounters between sex tourists and sex workers produce value that is simultaneously economic, embodied, and emotional, including the possibility of temporarily enhanced social status. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Latin America; masculinity; sex tourism; transnationality; value",,"Rivers-Moore, M.; Women and Gender Studies Institute, University of Toronto, Wilson Hall, 40 Willcocks Street, 2030, Toronto, ON M5S 1C6, Canada; email: megan.riversmoore@gmail.com",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871313514

While sexual abstinence may often be valued among adolescents, 'celibacy' among adults is considered problematic, associated with losses in health, well-being and general quality of life. Despite this, for various reasons, some people choose to deliberately avoid sexual activity (often conflated with coitus) with another person, even though they might continue to desire it. This article presents interview data detailing nine men's accounts of their choice to be 'celibate' or deliberately giving up sex for a period of time. Using thematic analysis, it presents two primary themes. First, that sex (despite the choice to be celibate) is still an imperative, and second, that celibacy becomes necessary as sex itself can be constructed as a problem. The analysis also examines how accounts of 'choice' and 'control' are used to define celibacy as a form of resistance to the power of the male sex-drive discourse, and yet simultaneously build upon hegemonic forms of masculine sense making such as a self-control, autonomy, and in some cases outright misogyny. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Celibacy; male sex drive; masculine sense making; masculinities; self-control",,"Terry, G.; Department of Psychology, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland Mail Centre, Auckland 1142, New Zealand; email: g.terry@auckland.ac.nz",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871322364

It argues that from the outset of the epidemic, those working in gay men's HIV prevention in Australia developed a new health education aesthetic, a safe-sex aesthetic, which packaged safe-sex information in ways that were sex positive and appealing to the target audience. At the same time, it presented safe sex as constitutive of a shared gay male identity, based on an ethics of mutual care and support. This aesthetic has proven immensely flexible in responding to and accommodating changes in the epidemic and gay male community over the past 25 years. However, it has led to attacks by conservative groups that gay men's HIV prevention has been less about prevention and more about promoting homosexuality. This article concludes that a safe-sex aesthetic was ahead of its time, modelling best-practice health promotion nearly a decade before it became official public health policy in Australia. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","Aesthetics; Australia; gay men; health promotion; HIV prevention; safe sex",,"Leonard, W.; Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society, La Trobe University, 215 Franklin Street, Melbourne, VIC 3000, Australia; email: W.Leonard@latrobe.edu.au",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871335531

Rather than considering such interventions, our central concern in this paper is to revisit debates about the interpretation of the issue, to explore whether boys' underachievement is indeed a 'problem', in the sense of both an empirical reality and an issue requiring political attention. In this paper, we explore contestations over the reality and complexity of educational underachievement and whether this relates to broader political-economic marginalisation (or privileging) of boys. We turn then to explore the relationship between material realities and gendered subjectivities. Overall, we argue that boys' underachievement should neither be ignored nor be the exclusive focus of attention and that a move from 'boys' underachievement' to a broader analysis of 'gender and education' is needed, to place the debate in a gender relational context. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","boys' underachievement; gender relational; marginalisation; privileging; problem",,"Cobbett, M.; Centre for Commonwealth Education, University of Cambridge Faculty of Education, 184 Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 8PQ, United Kingdom; email: mcc68@cam.ac.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867515285

This, it is hoped will encourage and maintain peace, as outlined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The second section draws upon work that interrogates the disconnection of gender from sex. Such work considers the importance of understanding schooling worlds through an untethering of gender categories from physical bodies. The third section suggests the possibility of a post-masculinity position by exploring research that questions the viability of masculinity as a conceptual frame to understand gender.

First, it is widely believed in the community that was studied that witches do, in fact, exist, and the images of witches are always female. Second, tribal women hold lower positions than men in all social, political, and ritual matters, and this contributes to their vulnerability during the hunt for scapegoats.

However, little research has focused specifically on the age at which this gender difference first emerges, and even less on the ethnic differences in smiling. This study attempts to identify the age when gender differences in smiling emerge among European American and African American children and teenagers. Additionally, we looked at the level of diversity within each school and its relation to smiling behavior. In total, 18,201 yearbook photographs ranging from kindergarten through 12th grade from 17 schools in the state of Michigan were evaluated for smile type: full smile, partial smile or no smile. Results suggest that a significant gender difference in smiling emerges around age 11. In contrast to other studies (e. g., LaFrance et al. 2003) and our own expectations, differences in smiling were found to be larger between African American boys and girls than between European American boys and girls. In addition, we found that African American girls' smiling behavior did not differ as a function of school diversity while African American boys from predominantly African American schools displayed less smiling compared to those from mixed or predominantly European-American schools. This study provides insight into the emergence and progression of gender differences in smiling and indicates that gender as well as ethnicity and ethnic diversity are influential factors in smiling behavior. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ethnicity; Gender; Smiling",,"Friedlmeier, M.; Psychology Department, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI 49401-9403, United States; email: friedlmm@gvsu.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865809898

We examined 186 children's (age: 9-13 years) self-reports on crying, catharsis, seeking support for feelings, and internalizing feelings. Girls reported a greater crying frequency and crying proneness, and more emotional and physical catharsis after crying. In addition, they more frequently sought support for feelings and more often experienced sadness and somatic complaints than boys. Seeking help for negative feelings and the experience of sadness and somatic complaints were positively associated with crying frequency and crying proneness. Emotional catharsis was positively linked to crying proneness. Support was found for the potential mediating role of sadness and somatic complaints with respect to the gender difference in crying frequency and for the potential mediating role of emotional catharsis and somatic complaints for crying proneness. This study demonstrates that gender differences in crying frequency already exist in middle childhood and the findings suggest a linkage between these gender differences in crying and psychosocial factors. © 2012 The Author(s).","Children; Crying; Development; Emotion expression; Gender; Tears",,"Jellesma, F.

The sample consisted of the 410 toys listed for boys and the 208 toys listed for girls, including 91 toys that appeared on both lists, on the English language U. S. Disney Store website. The marketing of toys on the Disney Store website is important not only because of the growth in e-commerce, but also because of this company's global domination of the children's entertainment industry. Tabular analysis and chi-square revealed that bold colored toys, predominantly red, black, brown, or gray toys, and those that were action figures, building toys, weapons, or small vehicles typified toys for ""boys only"" on this U. S. website. Pastel colored toys, predominantly pink or purple toys, and those that were dolls, beauty, cosmetics, jewelry, or domestic-oriented typified toys for ""girls only"". A majority of toys for ""both boys and girls"" were mostly ""gender-neutral"" in type, but they resembled toys for ""boys only"" in terms of their color palette, presumably to appeal to boys, who are less likely to cross gender lines than girls.

Children who perceived themselves as more gender-typical were more interested in same-gender-typed activities and occupations and less interested in other-gender-typed activities and occupations than children who perceived themselves as less gender-typical. Gender typicality was linked to gender stereotype endorsement, as predicted based on Liben and Bigler's (2002) dual-pathway model of gender development, with children who perceived themselves as less gender-typical having more egalitarian (less stereotyped) attitudes than children who perceived themselves as more gender-typical. The observed relations between gender-typed attributes and self-perceived gender typicality and between self-perceived gender typicality and gender stereotype endorsement did not differ across gender or age. These findings indicate that even young elementary-school-aged children use their knowledge of cultural gender roles to make subjective judgments regarding the self, and, conversely, that views of the self may influence personal endorsement of cultural gender stereotypes. Although the majority of extant research has focused on negative outcomes associated with low self-perceived gender typicality (e. g., low self-esteem), this research indicates that positive outcomes (e. g., flexible gender role attitudes) may also be associated with low self-perceived gender typicality. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender identity; Gender stereotyping; Gender typicality; Gender-typed attributes",,"Patterson, M.

The sample was composed of 2,724 images published in 36 textbooks by 10 Spanish publishing houses. A content analysis was carried out through the elaboration of an ad hoc coding scheme. The development of the coding scheme followed: two trial tests, two consultations with experts, and triangulation with three observers. The variables of the study were: gender, type of physical activity, field of practice, space and level. The findings showed a noticeable imbalance between male and female representation in which the male model is clearly predominant. In addition, these images portray males and females in stereotypical roles and depict certain activities or sports as more appropriate for one gender or the other. These findings further highlight the need to increase awareness regarding the image content in textbooks and the necessity to work in order to overcome traditional gender stereotypes connected with physical education and sport. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Content analysis; Gender stereotypes; Images; Physical education; Textbooks",,"Táboas-Pais, M.

Using paper dolls, we examined self-sexualization among sixty 6-9 year-old girls from the Midwestern United States; specifically self-identification, preference, and attributions regarding sexualized dress. Based on simultaneous maternal reports, we also investigated potential risk factors (media consumption hours, maternal self-objectification) and potential protective factors (maternal television mediation, maternal religiosity) for young girls' sexualization. Findings support social cognitive theory/social learning theory and reveal nuanced moderated effects in addition to linear main effects. Girls overwhelmingly chose the sexualized doll over the non-sexualized doll for their ideal self and as popular; however, dance studio enrollment, maternal instructive TV mediation, and maternal religiosity reduced those odds. Surprisingly, the mere quantity of girls' media consumption (tv and movies) was unrelated to their self-sexualization for the most part; rather, maternal self-objectification and maternal personal religiosity moderated its effects. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender roles/Schema; Mass media; Mother-daughter relationship; Self-objectification; Sexualization; TV mediation",,"Ferguson, G.

Design/methodology/approach - Covering 128 economies, it establishes six indicators of gender differences in formal laws and institutions: accessing institutions; using property; getting a job; dealing with taxes; building credit; and going to court. The first three indicators capture laws that have direct gender dimensions and are based on a reading of such laws from the perspective of individual women. The fourth indicator examines the direct and indirect gender implications of tax policy from the perspective of four standardised families with varying tax liabilities. The last two indicators examine the ease of access to credit bureaus and courts to examine the indirect effects that microfinance institutions and dispute resolution have on women, who are more likely to rely on non-traditional financial services. The questions used to construct each indicator were chosen based on data availability, economic relevance and variation of regulation across economies. Findings - The findings of the study pointed out that every region contains economies with unequal rules for men and women, with the extent of inequality varying by region. Research limitations/implications - This research does not test or analyse outcome variables of gender inequality; it simply identifies whether the law is equal for women and men, which can be a potential source of inequitable gender outcomes. Practical implications - This research offers valuable practical insights for employees and entrepreneurs to improve understanding of how legal and regulatory environments shape opportunities for women and contribute to more informed policy discussions. Originality/value - The paper provides interesting insights into research on linkages between legal differentiation and outcomes for women, and helps inform policy dialogue on things governments can do to expand women's opportunities. It is the first attempt to measure the gender gap in policy variables using quantitative and objective data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurialism; Gender; International economic policies; Legal parity; Women",,"Ahmad, S.Z.; Marketing and Management Department, College of Business Administration, Abu Dhabi University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; email: drszamberi@yahoo.com",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach - The quantitative approach involved a content analysis of three leading journals in the consumer behaviour discipline from 2006 to 2010: the Journal of Consumer Research, the Journal of Consumer Psychology and the Journal of Consumer Affairs, in order to ascertain how much research represents a gendered perspective. The qualitative approach involved analyzing the papers from a gendered perspective, to see if the papers were more conceptual or based on applied research, and to gauge the type of methodologies used. Findings - From 2006 to 2010 it was found that only an average of 2.4 per cent of 369 abstracts in JCR, 4 per cent of 224 abstracts in JCP and 5.8 per cent of 138 abstracts in JCA are from a gendered perspective. Approximately 25 per cent of the papers are steeped in applied research, while 75 per cent verify existing theories or expand to them. Research limitations/implications - The authors' qualitative analysis brings forward new results, namely that the very feministic perspective that has the potential to bring forth greater introspection in the consumer behavior research, namely feminist postmodernism, is in fact the least represented, with only one such paper out of 731, which is a possible wake-up call for feminist scholars. The authors conclude that the scope of the traditional paradigm can be enlarged by gendered scholarship. Originality/value - The paper represents a major effort to present the importance of including gendered perspective articles in marketing journals, to provide an analysis of the lack of a gendered perspective in papers published by three leading consumer-based journals, and to determine whether a gendered perspective can enrich the traditional framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour; Epistemology; Feminism; Feminist narratives; Gendered scholarship; Journals; Postmodernism; Research methodology; Research work; Theory building",,"Kumar, P.; XLRI Jamshedpur, Jamshedpur, India; email: payal.kumar@sagepub.in",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach - The study primarily employs a thematic analysis of publiclyavailable reports, documentation and pertinent academic work. Secondary, independent statistical analyses of nationally-representative data are used in order to provide the context and rationale for the policy analysis, and to overview key trends and ""problem"" areas in the service sector for working women in New Zealand. Findings - New Zealand has a high female labour force participation rate, with more than eight out of 10 female workers employed in service work. Although women remain over-represented in low-paid work, they have benefited from service sector growth, higher penetration of professional and managerial work, and some reduction in the gender pay gap. State interventions are justified in equity, labour market and welfare terms, with an emerging focus on ""decent work"" and productivity. Yet, this analysis of key initiatives for working women reveals an inadequate regulatory and policy framework. The significance and ""genderedness"" of service work to the economy means that it is increasingly but still insufficiently the focus of economic and social policy. Originality/value - This study responds to the absence of a contemporary and comprehensive assessment of the location and inequities experienced by different groups of women in New Zealand's service sector, particularly Mãori and Pasifika women.

The study draws on secondary data on the context to women's entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia, and on Brush et al.'s 5M framework to analyse the results of a survey of 33 Saudi women entrepreneurs in Jeddah in a variety of commercial sectors. The sample consists of female entrepreneurs who are already in business or in the process of establishing one, and who operate from a dedicated business premises away from home. In particular the study investigated the challenges and constraints faced, and the support and opportunities available for these female entrepreneurs. It was found that female entrepreneurs in Saudi Arabia are now establishing and managing more small and medium sized entities than at any time in the past and this trend is growing. This is in spite of significant challenges, both societal and institutional. The research suggests a number of ways in which institutions of state and trade – which often act as barriers to women practically running a business – could be overcome. These include provision of resources, training and mentoring, and eliminating some of the administrative procedures which require male representation in the establishment and financing female entrepreneurship. The paper presents original research on the growing phenomenon of female entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia. It positions explanations for this trend in the macro and micro economic context and in conceptualisations of female entrepreneurship. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Female entrepreneurship; Gender; Jeddah; Saudi Arabia",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

This is illuminated when engineering students are required to learn communication skills from female instructors. The authors’ analysis suggests that students’ resistance to communication instruction is gendered. Students often constructed hierarchical relationships where communication was considered “soft” in relation to the “hard” science of engineering instead of integral to the discipline and profession. Students resisted by expressing a lack of utility of information, devaluing feedback and instruction, degrading communication teachers, and questioning their bodies. The paper discusses implications of a gendered educational context and suggests ways interdisciplinary instruction can be utilized to enhance gender diversity. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Communication skills; Gender; Higher education; Mechanical engineering; Sciences; Students; United States of America; Universities",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on action research the authors document a workshop which they organised for different constituencies (administrators, researchers and feminist activists) working towards gender equality at an Austrian university and discuss its results in the context of feminist theory. Findings - The five voices collected at the workshop show that feminist theories are still the underlying guiding principles for feminist activism towards gender equality at managerial universities. As this is the first time that different generations of feminist activists have been present at managerial universities and are working in a top-down environment supported by administrators responsible for gender equality, common practices that have been successful to implement gender equality in the past have to be refined and new spaces for collaboration established. Originality/value - This is the first paper that explores the multiple voices amongst those engaged in the process of transformation towards gender equality at contemporary managerial universities.

In this paper the author aims to focus on the inauthentication of feminist academic work by powerful actors in higher education and the implications for feminist academic careers.

Findings - Drawing on notions of othering, interrupted and storied subjectivities, the author illustrates how gendered expectations and constructions of academic performance and success within patriarchal organisations can ""make up"" and ""break up"" the professional self and affect the nomadic nature of academic careers and identities.

Design/methodology/approach - The author identifies the unique position of Black feminism, which has had to define itself apart from second-wave feminism of the 1970s, which marginalised non-White women and the Civil Rights movement, which marginalised women. The oppression faced by Black feminists is apparent in the shifting platforms of identity that Black feminists occupy in the academy. Another obstacle is the restricted and incomplete picture of feminism in the academy, which sidelines Black feminist writing. One of the ways to raise awareness is to focus on the corpus of Black writing and to re-position it within academic core curricula, rather than relegating it to specialised courses. Findings - It is found that Black feminism is marginalised in the academy in scholarship and representation. It is also found that students are more receptive to ideas about feminism when approaching the subject indirectly. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of the study is an absence of theoretical literature from a UK context. Social implications - The paper highlights the marginalisation of Black feminism in the academy. Originality/value - The subjects of ""feminism in academia"" and the representation of ""Black and minority ethnics in the Academy"" have been explored in scholarship.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors critique the prevailing (corporate) institutional logic in higher education through their stories and experiences, weaving in diverse feminist perspectives. Liberal feminist perspectives, the most visible gender critique, may merely increase numerical equality, diversifying the biographical characteristics of privilege. Exclusion for many is systemically retained. The authors argue that relational logics underpinning indigenous worldviews hold generative potential for institutional change toward deeper inclusiveness and justice. Findings - Liberal feminists' two-fold transformative aspirations for gender equality and deeper respect for currently marginalized ""feminine"" values leave room for deeper and wider reflection on how indigenous perspectives might contribute to institutional change. Practical implications - This exploration may be applied to university recruiting, selection, evaluation, and promotion policies; articulating and assessing career competencies and trajectories; curriculum evaluation; organizational and management research; and pedagogical development and research.

There have been significant demographic, cultural and legislative shifts, but the authors' conversations demonstrate the endurance of imbalances of power and the continuing need for a feminist politics of difference which can engage with contemporary life in the academy. Design/methodology/approach - This is primarily a theoretical paper that adopts feminist approaches to reflection and dialogue. The article is designed to bring together lived experience across generations, feminist theories and methodologies and the implications for activism. The paper uses the device of ""I-Kath I-Sophie"" as part of an autoethnographic approach to the cross-generational conversation. Findings - Far from being redundant, the authors argue that feminist critiques of inequalities that are often manifest in women's invisibility and silence even in the academy in the twenty-first century - there is still the need to support a politics of difference and to explore ways of giving women a voice. The persistence of inequalities means that feminist battles have not been entirely won. The authors argue for dialogue between the feminisms of mothers and daughters. Research limitations/implications - Feminist concepts and arguments from what has been called the ""second wave"" are still useful, especially in relation to maintaining the category woman as a speaking subject who can engage in collective action. Practical implications - The authors' arguments support the continuation of spaces for women to share experience within the academy, for example in feminist reading groups and through women's networks. Social implications - Feminist theories and activism remain important political forces for women in the academy today and post feminism is a questionable conceptualisation and phenomenon. In times when feminist battles may seem to have been won there remain issues to explore in relation to a new problem with no name.

Through notions of engaged political pedagogy (as developed by bell hooks Jacques Ranciére), it proposes an intersectional and dissensual approach to teaching, as a primary way of practising feminist politics within academia. Design/methodology/approach - The paper sets out to explore the possibility of a feminist pedagogy of teaching. Drawing on works by social and feminists theorists as well as by radical pedagogues, it negotiates these various standpoints, finding similarities and differences, in order to formulate ways in which we can more fruitfully conceive of teaching as politics. Findings - The paper proposes that the classroom proves one of the most radical spaces for possibility within academia. Through an engaged, dissensual pedagogy, in which both students and teachers work together in mutual recognition of each other's knowledge, the feminist teacher can enthuse political change both within and outside of the classroom.

The aim is to grapple with the personal experiences of a ""change agent"" in a tertiary education sector that is going through political transformation. The author also reflects on the impact of neo-liberal capitalism on tertiary institutions, and its depoliticising effect on feminist activism. It engages the establishment of gender studies programs. Design/methodology/ approach - The article is a viewpoint and uses the personal reflections of a feminist scholar at a South African university to illustrate issues of personal location at a university as a site of struggle, but also location in the global South. It elaborates on the difficulty of changing male dominated institutional cultures and ways in which feminist activism is subverted. Findings - The article shows how the experiences of being a change agent make ""the personal political"" and this contributes to taking a psychological toll. It exposes the intransigence toward change in hierarchical male dominated institutional cultures and recommends feminist solidarity across tertiary institutions, as well as using institutional opportunities for feminist purposes as counter measures to co-option. Originality/value - The value of the article is located in the reflection of a feminist scholar on her own experiences in the context of a South African university but may open a space for feminist scholars in tertiary institutions globally to relate to these experiences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Activism; Feminist academic; Gender studies; Intersectionalities; Neo-liberalism; North-south divide; Sex and gender issues; South Africa",,"Gouws, A.; Department of Political Science, University of Stellenbosch, Stellenbosch, South Africa; email: ag1@sun.ac.za",,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

LGBs who resided in rural areas tended to feel less connected to LGB communities and experienced higher levels of felt stigma and enacted discrimination. Small town inhabitants displayed some similar patterns, but also reported lower levels of enacted discrimination than expected.

However, an intersectional pedagogical approach may strengthen student understanding of not only the LGBT psychology but also the matrix of oppression as related to a multitude of social inequalities. This article presents instructors' reflections documenting the benefits and challenges of using critical liberatory feminist pedagogy and an intersectional framework in teaching two courses, Black Issues in LGBT Psychology and Psychology of Gender, Race, and Sexuality within the cultural contexts of a historically Black university and a Hispanic-serving university. Examples of assignments and student reactions are provided. Implications are drawn for diversity-themed courses that may focus exclusively on race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and/or gender identity without attention to intersections of race, gender, class, religion, ability or national origin. This ignores powerful pedagogical opportunities to advance students' critical consciousness. Instructors' use of an intersectional pedagogical approach can provide opportunities to enhance student consciousness regarding multiple identities and oppression and, subsequently, may result in increased student action to promote social change towards group equality. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critical liberatory feminist pedagogy; cultural contexts; Hispanic-serving institution; historically Black university; intersectional; LGBT psychology",,"Case, K.

Whereas prior research has examined the 'coming out stories' of other sexual minorities (lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals and polyamorous individuals), little scholarly attention has been paid to narratives of initial interest in BDSM. A total of 144 women and 128 men who self-identified as being involved in BDSM responded to a questionnaire that included the open-ended item 'What first attracted you to BDSM? Please describe the reasons why you first became interested in BDSM as a sexual practice or orientation'. Using thematic analysis, we identified two mutually exclusive explanations for initial BDSM interests: (1) BDSM interests are an intrinsic part of the self and (2) BDSM interests developed because of external influences. Analyses revealed very few differences in the endorsement of these themes by either gender or BDSM role. The only gender differences found were among submissive participants: a greater proportion of men than women cited 'intrinsic self', whereas a greater proportion of women than men cited 'external influences'. Additionally, a small number of participants (primarily women and primarily submissives) described a 'socialised essentialism', in which external influences initially brought them to BDSM, but these interests were then experienced as an essential part of themselves. We discuss these findings in relation to prior research on the meanings of BDSM practice for participants, in terms of current theorising about the role of stories in the development of one's sexual self, and in relation to essentialist, constructionist and dynamical theories of sexual identity development. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","BDSM; essentialism; sadomasochism; sexual stories",,"Yost, M.

The specific aims of this article are twofold: (1) to begin to explore the role that religion and spirituality may play in the lives of transgender and intersex individuals and (2) to provide a roadmap for psychologists and other social scientists to conduct future research in this area. We began by conducting a literature review of intersex and transgender religiosity and spirituality. After summarising the articles uncovered, we then offer suggestions on how current psychological methods and theories - including spiritual journeys, empowerment, positive psychology and stress-related growth - can be used to advance research on the role that religious and spiritual beliefs play in intersex and transgender lives.

Using the literature on stigmatization of LGBT peoples, minority stress, and the demonstrated under-representation of LGBT issues (including heterosexism) in psychology, we argue that the Institutes served a necessary and timely - if not overdue - intervention to establish an 'invisible college' that allowed emerging scholars to connect with eminent senior scholars. This was the starting point for systematic and sustained collaborations among the scholars in attendance, and some of the fruits of those collaborations are included in this issue. Post-institute participant surveys from both sessions revealed that the Institutes not only facilitated the formation of an 'invisible college', but that participants also reported individual shifts in perspective associated with an increased commitment to social change: the development of new networks, critical perspectives on the inclusion of LGBT people/and issues, shifts in identity, and new possibilities for reaching (and changing) other people through research and teaching.

By analyzing data in an original, national web-based survey of black, Latino, and white public opinion, results indicate most blacks strongly subscribe to several of these themes and often subscribe to them more than non-blacks.

Political consciousness also meant cultural consciousness. Cultural consciousness involved critical assessment of how one should live and how one should consume, which created space for new commodities and markets. An important but overlooked dimension of this evolving social milieu for African-Americans was the search to produce a better person. This search was expressed through a human potential movement that was embedded in the broader movements mentioned above. This focus on human potential characteristically embraced spirituality, lifestyle and dietary change, naturalistic and alternative health care, and self-help efforts, believed to be fundamental to create a progressive, healthy, and liberated Black community. Comedian and social activist Dick Gregory became a highly visible symbol and proponent of this movement, drawing strength from pre-existing African-American innovators and entrepreneurs.

We hypothesized that the children of African-American parents who reported more traditional authoritarian beliefs, maternal confidence, and maternal warmth would display higher levels of cognitive development and achievement at school entry. Multiple regression analysis indicated that maternal confidence and warmth were predictive of cognitive development and achievement.

While all policy is about the struggle over values and categories, conceptually prostitution policy can best be understood as an instance of morality politics. Without hypostatizing morality politics, we define it as having six characteristics: it is ruled by an explicit ideology; experts have limited authority as everyone feels they ""own"" prostitution policy; it is highly emotionally charged; it is resistant to facts; the symbolism of policy formulation is seen as more important than policy implementation; and it is subject to abrupt changes. We then analyze three implications of the adversarial nature of prostitution policy. First, we discuss the cavalier attitude of relevant actors towards precise and reliable numbers. Second, by focusing on ""forced prostitution"" and ""trafficking"", we discuss the ideological and obfuscating nature of key concepts in prostitution policy. We suggest instead using the concept of ""exploitation"". Finally, we focus on policy implementation. We argue that the common concept of policy regime has limited value and that to understand the development of prostitution policy, its outcomes, and its impact on society, attention to the mundane details of policy implementation is required. The paper suggests some conditions to prevent prostitution policy to enter the realm of morality politics and to attain an effective and humane form of policy making. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Exploitation; Morality politics; Policy implementation; Policy instruments; Prostitution; Sex worker; Trafficking",,"Wagenaar, H.; Department of Town and Regional Planning, University of Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TN, United Kingdom; email: hendrik.wagenaar@gmail.com",,,18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

The legalization made a distinction between voluntary sex work, which is legal, and forced prostitution, which remains a criminal offence. In the 2000s, evaluations showed that, while there is a reasonably working legal prostitution sector, abuse, bad working conditions and trafficking still occur. The media have played an important role in reframing the issue, and politicians have successfully set the revision of the legalization on the agenda, resulting in a new bill at the end of the decade. With this proposal and its framing of fighting human trafficking and organized crime, the Netherlands is reneging on its original progressive legalization by adopting a strict regulation of all prostitution. Sex workers will have to register with the authorities; the age to work in the sex industry will be raised to 21 years and clients have to check whether the sex worker is registered and not an undocumented worker.

In Portuguese legislation, prostitution has not been a crime per se since 1982, but activities related to prostitution, including pimping and benefitting from the prostitution of others, are considered crimes. This legal inconsistency is further complicated by the lack of specific policies addressing the living and working conditions of sex workers. At the same time, growing concern about sex trafficking has resulted in a new set of policies that ultimately influence the regulation of prostitution, in particular the prostitution of immigrant women.

The German tradition has been long been regulatory. Sex work is permissible under certain conditions depending on the location (vicinity to schools and churches must be avoided), the registration (for taxation purposes), and the migratory status of the sex worker (illegal immigrants or tourists ought not to ply the streets). In addition, one has to be of a certain age, compos mentis, and engage in sex work using a certain amount of discretion. Otherwise, one moves into the realm of illegality. The regulatory measures traditionally aim at maintaining three public goods: public mores, public health, and public order. To these desiderata, the prostitution law of 2002 added a new public objective: labor rights for sex workers. The legislators' intent was to remove stigma and improve working conditions. This law remains without much effect in practice. In this paper, I try to show why. First, the governments of the Länder refuse (or fail) to pass implementation guidelines. Second, the old logics of interference prevail at an institutional level.

Drawing on the Chilean case, this paper examines the opportunities and constraints for producing positive gender outcomes in health policy. The paper argues that only limited progress has been made in integrating gender issues into the health sector despite several entry points introduced over the past decade. Part of the explanation lies in the continuing dominance of economic technocrats in the design of health sector reform. Even where attention is given to gender within the health sector, it has been narrowly defined, with a predominant focus on ""equity"" rather than ""equality"" issues and an on-going failure to acknowledge the contribution of the care economy in the majority of health reform debates. At the same time, relatively few women's organizations work on these issues and much of the work to broaden out notions of gender and health and push for change has fallen to a few key individuals. The Chilean political context has also limited the possibility for pushing for change within the health sector despite progress in other areas of social policy. © 2012 The Author.",,,"Gideon, J.; Birkbeck College, University of London, London, United Kingdom; email: j.gideon@bbk.ac.uk",,,10724745,,,,"English","Soc.

A recent phenomenon synthesizes the activity of flash mobs and street gangs. Communities everywhere have experienced the negative effects of street gangs, and their proliferation has led to an increase in destructive crimes in the United States. A flash gang is a group that uses a social media connection to invite participants to a time and location where they commit a crime and then they split up. Local law enforcement needs to examine response policies to prepare for this new and dangerous phenomenon. Recent protests in the Middle East and North Africa were coordinated using similar strategies, spotlighting the power of using social media technology to oppose government action. The spontaneity and secrecy of the flash mob combined with the targeted crime and/or violence of the street gang produces a mix that is hard to combat even with inside intelligence.

This study also examines the business case for having women on boards. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 228 IPO companies that went public during the period 1999-2006, this study tracks the changes in the gender composition of these companies prior to the IPO year, IPO year and three-year post-IPOs. This study also tracks the changes in the gender composition between the pre-IPO period and some 5 to 12 years later after the IPOs for a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies on the Malaysian Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) in 2011. The compounded buy-and-hold returns method is used to measure the post-IPO company performance. Findings: This study finds that female representation as board of directors in 228 Malaysian companies prior to the IPO is only about 8 percent. This percentage is almost similar for the subsequent four years (IPO year and three-year post-IPOs). By using a subsample of 89 companies that appear as top 500-companies in 2011, the percentage of female directors increases only 2.5 percent from the pre-IPO year. However, the increment is not statistically significant. An extended analysis on the business case for women on boards reveals that greater percentage of female representation leads to lower long run underperformance. This underperformance is much lower for companies having more foreign ethnic female representation. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study suggest that there is still a long way to realize the benefits of having female directors in Malaysian companies. Malaysia needs to create an environment that realizes the benefits of having women in the top management levels.

This connection has been largely ignored in recent research on pornography. Yet, if it is reasonable to posit that the heritage bequeathed by three centuries of concern over masturbation has not been entirely dispelled, then a question presents itself: What can an examination of the history of masturbation tell us about the digital pornography that circulates around the internet today? This article seeks to provide an answer to this question via a genealogical rereading of the history of masturbation from the perspective of the present. It suggests that the campaign against masturbation in the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries was characterized by a heteronormative framing that situated the practice as a threat not only to the social order, but also to a natural order presumed to underlie and ground human social relations. In this context, masturbation was especially problematic for boys and men as it represented a loss of control over (their own) nature, thereby undermining their masculine status. Ultimately, the article argues that a focus on the history of masturbation allows us to appreciate the extent to which it is central to the way in which masculinity is produced via pornography. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Heteronormativity; History; Masculinity; Masturbation; Pornography; Sexuality",,"Garlick, S.; Department of Sociology, University of Victoria, Box 3050, STN CSC, Victoria, BC V8W 3P5, Canada; email: sgarlick@uvic.ca",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

Based on a breakdown of narrative structure into six narrative components-act, context, purpose, actors, agency and consequences-this narrative component method of comparison provides a way of accounting for the considerable differences in Japanese and Chinese premarital sexual norms. Both Chinese and Japanese students' normative cultural scenarios for entry into sexual intercourse situate sexual intercourse within a ""love"" relationship; but narrative component analysis reveals key differences in the construction of acts, agents and contexts. Both the Japanese and Chinese findings point to a process of re-embedding sexual behavior in sexual scripts associated with a narrower scope of relational purposes and specific social contexts. The differential embedding of sexual scripts in an idealized relational context is shown to be relevant for the cultural construction of sexual agency. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","China; Comparative research; Japan; Premarital sexuality; Sexual agency; Sexual scripts; Virginity",,"Farrer, J.; Sophia University, Tokyo, Japan; email: jim_farrer@yahoo.com",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

It aims to articulate a philosophical reflection on women's political past and the disperse fragments of the history of women (herstory) in Our America. This reading will be based on the Benjaminian thought about the relationship between past and present. From this point of view, the past that concerns subalterns is the jetzt zeit, a present time that is fed from the regard to the past. Namely, in this case, the relationship between a significant time of the History of Our America - the time of the Independence Wars during the nineteen century - and the present. At the time new horizons were opened, then anticipated as the inauguration of a new time and a new political order. This reflection is focused on the relationship between body, politics and History/Herstory with the attempt to build situated and critical knowledge against the idea of the a-historical character of subordination of women, to transform it into what Genevieve Fraisse called a ""querelle"", that is a timeless debate in which the endless repetition of the same situation is at play.

Even though the Bahraini ""Day of Rage"" movement was ultimately marginalized at large, it had unlikely consequences for Bahraini women. As female empowerment has been a high priority on the government's agenda, participation of women in the public sphere serves important functions and in the aftermath of Bahraini uprising it got an additional boost. The aim of this paper is to assess how the role of Bahraini women has been interwoven with political liberalization reforms in the first decade on the 21st century and assess its importance for the Bahraini authorities. Secondly, it aims at analyzing the outcomes of Arab Spring uprising for Bahraini women. It asserts that as the pro-government and anti-government movements took to the streets, social divisions of Bahrainis deepened and equally, affected female activists.

We focus on the efforts of the women's movement in Guatemala to address questions of justice and healing for survivors of gendered violence during Guatemala's 36-year internal armed conflict. We discuss how the initial transitional justice measures of documenting gendered war crimes in the context of a genocide were subsequently taken up by the women's movement and how their endeavors to further expose sexual violence have resulted in notable interventions. Interviews with key organizational activists as well as testimonies given by victims of sexual violence during the conflict suggest that transitional justice mechanisms, extended by women's movements' efforts, are creating conditions for the emergence of new practices and spaces that support the fragile cultivation of new subjectivities. Sujetas de cambio (subjects of change) are premised not on victimhood but survivorhood. The emergence of these new subjectivities and new claims, including greater personal security and freedom from everyday violence, must be approached with caution, however, as they are not born automatically out of the deeply emotional struggles that play out around historical memory. Still, their emergence suggests new ways for women to cope not only with the sexual violence of the past but also to work against the normative violence that is part of their present.","Gendered violence; Historical memory; Transitional justice",,"Patterson-Markowitz, R.; International Interdisciplinary Studies, University of ArizonaUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Methodology: A cross sectional survey was used where both quantitative and qualitative data were collected utilizing a self-administered questionnaire. A convenience sample of 500 Jordanian women was selected from women working in political and leadership positions in various settings including government, Non Government Organizations (NGOs), business, educational and academic institutions. The Study involved a self administered questionnaire with closed and open ended questions that include the demographic and personal questions, barriers hindering Jordanian women's advancement to higher political and leadership positions and main actions/strategies to facilitate Jordanian women's advancement to higher political and leadership positions. Findings: In their endeavour toward advancement in leadership positions in work and community, women face major obstacles and impediments. These barriers encompass a wide range of obstacles, which include political and legal, personal, family, socio-cultural, and economic barriers. Discrimination against women was a cross cutting issue for all barriers. Political and Legal support, awareness raising and empowerment of women were main issues suggested by women leaders to enhance to higher political and leadership positions. Women should work hard to stick to the heart of the Awakening and fight rather than demand by the name of democracy for their rights in politics and the building of their nation. Recommendations: The study suggests establishment of solid gender-sensitive policies, empowerment of women by strengthening their leadership abilities and capabilities, awareness raising of society about women role in development and involvement of women in the making of democracy and political reform to play an active role in all higher national committees and task groups of political reform.","Arab spring; Barriers to women advancement; Democracy; Jordanian women",,"Maaitah, R.A.; Jordan University of Science and TechnologyJordan",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Yet, when the nation does not have a clear idea of the geographical parameters of its territory, the boundaries often get defined by others and through war. In the case of Israel, however, especially since 1967, the Jewish homeland has been defined and shaped not simply by war but by government policies that support the Settlement Project in the occupied territories of the West Bank. While Jewish men and women historically have had different roles in defining Israel's boundaries-men as defenders of borders and women as enablers and reproducers of the nation - it is Jewish men who have been perceived as central to the Zionist Project, not women. But as this article suggests, such perspective is simplistic, for women, especially settlers, as leaders and always as willing practitioners in the Settlement Projects, have helped shape the geographical and, more importantly, the psychological parameters of the homeland. With each attempt to settle all parts of the West Bank, even in the most remote outposts, and refusing to compromise over what the homeland includes, these settlers have challenged the memory of a ""Smaller Israel"" in favor of a ""Greater Israel."" In their actions therefore, they have been at the forefront of the struggle over the memory of boundary and, thus, are challenging the boundary of memory.","Boundaries; Gender; Memory; New zionists; Settlers",,"Mayer, T.; International Studies Program, Rohatyin Center for International Affairs, Middlebury CollegeUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

True political reform in Afghanistan is contingent upon the solving of these problems, as women's education is essential not only for the development of a more stable government, but also for raising living standards. Women's lack of access to education in Afghanistan is reinforced by beliefs rooted in the religious and familial tradition of community. Although Islamic ideologies have often been distorted and manipulated by leaders to control and subjugate the lives of women, Islam cannot be ignored in the democratization of Afghanistan; it plays too great a role in Afghan society. Therefore, Islam must be respected and invoked as a catalyst to promote women's education and rights. The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan presents a complex landscape in which to examine the gender roles and relations generally, and a woman's access to education specifically, as they are embedded in the country's history and religious ideology. The democratization of education requires a pluralistic education model that involves State and nongovernmental sectors, including secular and non-secular institutions, making itself accessible and acceptable to the greatest number of Afghans possible. Education that teaches and encourages critical thought, ijtihad, and introduces concepts of gender equality-supported by Qur'anic scholarship led by Islamic feminists-is imperative. This is a bottom-up approach to education, which centralizes the needs and interests of Afghan women and girls. It is the aim of this chapter to explore the possibilities of education for girls as a motivating influence on democratization and how a pluralistic approach to education can alleviate the historical gender inequities that have hindered the country for centuries.","Afghanistan; Girls' education; Islamic feminism; Pluralistic education",,"Kissane, C.; Center for Global Affairs (CGA), NYUUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

To do so, we utilize a schema of information production and consumption devised to analyze activist engagement and citizen journalism, particularly the negotiation of communication messages by various agents through multiple stages of transmission and dissemination (Newsom, Lengel, & Cassara, C, 2011). We look at the ideal of local knowledge as it is transformed into global knowledge, and how the messages are open to manipulation and bias through the various stages of mediation and gatekeeping cited in the framework. Through the application of this framework, we can see how gendered messages are constructed, essentialized, reconstructed, and made invisible by the consumer media system.","Arab countries, History, Arab Spring Uprisings, 2011, Activism; Democracy; Egypt; Feminism; Online social networks; Protest movements; Revolution, Social Media, Social conditions; Symbolic Interactionism; Tunisia",,"Newsom, V.A.; Department of Communication Studies, Social Sciences and Humanities Division, Olympic CollegeUnited States; email: vnewsom@olympic.edu",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

The paper demonstrates that the backlash did not emerge suddenly after Mubarak was ousted from power, but that dissent against Mubaraks' decisions pertaining to women was prevalent in the media long before the 25th of January revolution.

Drawing from scholarship in the emotional turn of social movement theory and using Deborah Gould's concept of emotional habitus, it aims at describing the dominant social moods at different moments of the revolutionary process, in order to address how these emotions fostered or, on the contrary, inhibited protest for social change. For this purpose, the article considers personal blogs as a modified form of Lauren Berlant's intimate publics, alternative spaces through which affect circulates and a shared understanding of reality is constructed. Through qualitative content analysis of 11 personal blogs written by Egyptian women, the article tracks the different emotional habitus through their narratives. It will shed light on how a pre-revolutionary mood of frustration and resignation gave way, after the revelation of Khaled Said's murder by the police and the success of the Tunisian revolution, to an emotional habitus characterized by hope that opened a political horizon of change and culminated in Mubarak's resignation after 18 days of protest. Once the regime was toppled, however, the personal discourses published in the selected blogs testify to how the economic difficulties and the political instability of the reconstruction time contributed to modify the euphoric mood of the uprisings and turn it into an affective state of frustration and disappointment.","Egypt; Emotions; Personal blogs; Qualitative content analysis; Revolution; Women",,"Galán, S.; Women's and Gender Studies, Rutgers UniversityUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Emerging from an abject position in a colonial jail the poet drew on the representational and allusive properties of poetry to heal and transform the role of victim so as to expose gross human rights abuses and hold colonial officials, the colonial state, and French culture to account. Predicated upon the recognition of very diverse audiences, the visionary poem invokes and explores emerging transitional justice and peace-making processes, decades before their formal appearance. It also demonstrates the value of creative communication strategies under conditions of extreme oppression and division. Using a Critical Theory lens with intersectional analysis, Djabali's text may be read as innovatively connecting individual testimony to the nascent national processes of transitional justice and peace-making.

It draws on data from a recent ethnographic study of minority ethnic pupils' experiences in secondary schools in England and interrogates the tensions between the research aim to challenge racial stereotyping in education and issues of race and power emerging from the research process. This article investigates specifically the ways in which interaction is shaped by - frequently hidden, particularly to those privileged by them - structures of white supremacy. Developing an innovative analytical framework which draws on insights from both critical race theory and the work of Judith Butler, the researcher problematises issues of voice and representation in conducting social justice research. It is argued that an approach which engages with elements of both structural and post-structural theory allows a more critical exploration of white supremacy through an understanding of the performativity of race. The author works towards a possible research methodology which not only takes into account, but also tries to destabilise processes of white supremacy in research by both recognising participants' efforts to do this, and trying to make researchers better able to take responsibility for their own complicity in perpetuating unequal racial structures. It is argued that such a recognition by white researchers will necessarily be an uncomfortable process. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critical race theory; Judith Butler; social justice research; voice and representation; white supremacy",,"Chadderton, C.; Cass School of Education, University of East London, London, United Kingdom; email: c.chadderton@uel.ac.uk",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

Much of this has been in the service of a participatory citizenship agenda, as articulated in the Every Child Matters agenda in England, in the work of the UK's Children's Commissioners and through service provider commitment to consultation with young people more generally. However throughout this period there has also been a sustained critique of the UK Government's citizenship agenda for young people, and consequently of the role of participatory research and consultation processes within this. Much of this critique questions what kind of citizenship young people are being asked to participate in, juxtaposing the construction of 'inclusive' participatory spaces with an increasingly stratified and exclusionary context for participation in the social and economic arenas of society. This article reflects on this debate using material from a two-year ethnographic project with a small group of year six and seven primary school girls from a Scottish urban area long designated as having a high concentration of people struggling with socio-economic disadvantage and exclusion. The project blended the more traditional ethnographic approach of observation and reflection with a series of participatory activities with the group. These activities took place within an after school club which they named 'Community Matters'. This article examines the various activities of the club and the differing meanings of and associations with 'community' that the girls depicted and discussed. These situated meanings are then contrasted to the assumptions that underpin children's role within the evaluation systems that govern services to children. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","children; community development; doxa; participation; space",,"Cross, B.; School of Education, University of the West of Scotland, Ayr, United Kingdom; email: beth.cross@stir.ac.uk",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

Qualitative interviews with women and men across different hierarchical levels and departments show that long hours are an indicator of commitment and potential for career progression, thus suggesting that accounting firms' organizational culture and accountants' professional identity predominate in different cultural contexts. However, paternalistic masculinity and 'the father' figure appear to characterize management control in the Mexican context, in contrast to most previous studies conducted in developed countries.

A series of extracts from the field demonstrate how that humour is deployed in versatile and creative ways in order to refuse and subvert a direct questioning of traditional, hegemonic masculinity in the classroom. In the specific context discussed here the boys are responding to a recent Irish educational initiative known as the Exploring Masculinities programme. This programme, through its presentation of 'alternative' masculine identities, offered an overt challenge to long-established and deeply felt understandings of what constitutes a 'real man'. Analysis of the responses of the boys to the programme materials suggests not only the importance of humour as a defensive and supportive tool in the continuance of traditional hierarchies of maleness, but also the repressive nature of the boys' compulsory 'hard-man' masculinity. Replete with misogynistic and homophobic references, this humour and its deployment shows a rigidly structured masculine identity, rooted in the past and heavily entrenched in their present. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ethnography; humour; performance; school; subversion; young masculinities",,"Barnes, C.; University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland; email: cliona.barnes@ul.ie",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

By examining an extended excerpt of interaction taken from the popular US reality TV show The Apprentice, I examine the role of gender stereotyping and gender assumptions in the assessment of (im)politeness by the discourse participants. Following Mills (2002), I shall argue that gender plays a role in the judgments of (im)politeness by the interactants, and that judgments seem to vary among individuals. The analysis shows that a woman's relatively masculine verbal behaviour, albeit politic in view of the stereotypically 'masculine' context, is perceived as inappropriate and impolite. It is suggested that women professionals may be subjected to more stringent gender norms which govern what constitutes polite behaviour, as linguistic behaviour may be evaluated against the 'norms' of women's speech which is assumed to be stereotypically more polite than men's speech.

Recent years have seen the increased popularity of so-called 'Daddy porn' catering for (and creating) an interest in the older man and the mature body as a site of erotic fascination.The essay discusses the implications of this development by focusing on the narrative, discursive, and representational strategies of texts that present the older male as a sexual figure.

ADT causes loss of muscle mass and body hair; genital shrinkage and erectile dysfunction; variable amounts of breast growth and the development of a characteristically post-menopausal female pattern of fat distribution. ADT also changes mood and affect, most conspicuously seen as increased emotionality and depressed libido. Given these changes, it is not surprising that many patients on ADT no longer feel 'manly', yet do not experience themselves as women. For many, this gender liminality is psychologically and socially traumatic. Faced with these difficulties, how can castrated males understand themselves in a positive way?We explore the idea that some men may benefit from embracing the alternative gender identity of 'eunuch'.

Attending to these truths requires being prepared to disrupt 'familiar' narratives of victimhood and perpetration, and remember our own potential affiliations with violence, whether personal or national. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Szörényi, A.; School of Social Sciences, University of AdelaideAustralia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

Recognising the colonialist agenda in the sources when it comes to representing white women as well as Indigenous women, we must be cognisant of the constraints and silences of women's self-representation. Undoubtedly, relationships between women in colonial contact zones were more complex, and uneasy, than the surviving records by colonial male authorities admit.

Among Martin's publications was The Incredible Journey, the first Australian novel to feature an Aboriginal woman as its central character. Largely due to Margaret Allen's subsequent work, Catherine Martin's literary reputation has grown; and so too has research and debate about race relations in colonial Australia. Allen's work on white women writing in the contact zone and other themes has made a vital contribution to the emergence of critical race and whiteness studies in Australia.

A close reading of mainstream third-wave texts demonstrates that while they incorporate some ideas, theories, and bodies of women-of-color feminism, there are four key syntactical moves that contain and dilute the transformative impact of antiracist feminist scholarship and serve to maintain whiteness.

We identified 117 total dissertations and coded their topics, themes, and methodologies. We found eight dominant dissertation topics: identity/subjectivity, gender norms, resistance/activism/power, cultural texts, nationalism/citizenship, harassment/violence/victimization/trauma, race, and sexuality. While humanities-based methodologies, particularly historical and representational, dominate the sample, they are often combined with qualitative or ethnographic methods, particularly interviewing. Regardless of the methods employed or discussed, reflexivity, lived experience, and agency constituted the core of feminist methodology for many dissertation writers. We analyze the successes and challenges of producing interdisciplinary dissertations in freestanding women's studies programs and provide an analysis of a select number of dissertations purposefully chosen to reflect larger trends. Challenges discussed include failure to specify (with precision) key terms such as intersectionality, interdisciplinarity, and transnationality; not providing a sufficient discussion of feminist methodology to justify the link between argumentation and evidence; not choosing topics outside of the writer's comfort zone; and not problematizing the connection between experience, identity, and knowledge.

If sustained and multifaceted minority feminist activism was occurring in the late 1960s and through the 1970s, is a characterization of the 1980s as the era of multiracial feminism still accurate? I employ a comparative historical and content analysis of writings from the late 1960s through the 1980s to determine what, if any, important distinctions occurred between those two time periods. I find that writing was an important mechanism for communication and debate in the 1970s and the 1980s, but there were significant differences in terms of the locations in which the writing occurred and, by extension, the source of editorial control over said writing. The issue of racial solidarity dominated the race-movement and white-feminist-controlled spaces of many 1970s publications, and thus limited the conversation, primarily because the locations drove audience and content, restricting coverage to those themes deemed relevant to a nonminority feminist audience. In contrast, the hallmark of autonomous women of color's writings of the 1970s and 1980s was the freedom associated with independently controlled publishing spaces that provided more physical space for debate, as well as the autonomy to engage those themes deemed most relevant to them. It was this autonomy, combined with political changes that allowed for a concentrated focus on feminist alliances, that merits a designation of the 1980s as the decade of multiracial feminism. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Drawing on feminist analysis, the article outlines some of the key assumptions that are mobilized in children's rights practices and questions the implications of such assumptions. It begins with a historical overview of children's municipal defensorías as well as an explanation of how these spaces currently function and how they are used. The conception of children's rights in these spaces is largely technocratic, with the family serving as the primary site for intervention. On the one hand, this conception of children and their rights has mobilized the state to support poor women's claims for child support from men. Yet at the same time, this article suggests, this technical (and mainly economic) interpretation of children's rights turns impoverished women first and foremost into mothers and depends on a rubric that feminizes childhood and children's rights, making children viable actors only if seen through the advocacy of their mothers (and within individual families). This article therefore addresses the implications of the ambiguous consequences in these offices, which seem to help the women who use them in the short term by providing critical financial assistance while also hindering the chance for long-term or more structural change. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

In seeking to surmount this perceived inadequacy, both thinkers counterposed alternative theoretical frameworks for analyzing women's oppression that nonetheless relied upon certain of Marxism's central tenets. In a reliance that took the form of strikingly similar translations of Marxism foregrounding what came to be known as radical feminism (in the case of MacKinnon) and queer theory (in the case of Rubin), both theorists problematically render class as, respectively, gender and heterosexuality. Missing what an analysis of sex work as a site of the metamorphosis of the commodity has to tell us about the lived intersectionality of capitalism and patriarchy in individual and collective lives, feminists writing in MacKinnon and Rubin's wake typically frame their discussions of sex work-including those that are ostensibly pro-sex worker-in terms of gender and sexuality rather than class. I argue that this flattening of sex work-predicated upon MacKinnon's and Rubin's translation of class as identity rather than as a dynamic, antagonistic relation between capital and labor-has facilitated feminism's and queer theory's unwitting complicity with capitalism, manifested in a lack of attention to women's privilege and oppression not as women and sexual minorities per se but as workers, commodities, and even capitalists. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

The movement is unusual in the evangelical Christian context because the vast majority of lay activists and leaders are women. Furthermore, there are multiple sites of negotiation within the movement indicating that gender hierarchy is neither absolute nor taken for granted. These conflicts are enabled by gender essentialism, yet they destabilize the patriarchal bargain between women and men at both the national and local levels. First, the movement as a whole comes into conflict with the larger evangelical context as activists claim that, as women, they have legitimate authority to determine the authentic Christian response to crisis pregnancy and abortion. Thus, they compete with evangelical leaders by constructing gendered interpretations of religious doctrine that expand women's autonomy over ""women's issues."" In terms of everyday practices, firsthand experiences with crisis pregnancy and abortion prompt a sense of gender identification that leads activists to prioritize clients' nonreligious needs over movement goals. The failure of evangelical critics to reverse these trends demonstrates women's centrality within conservative politics and their power to reshape gender ideology and religious identity. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

This essay focuses on an even smaller subset of this small group: those Romani women activists who are struggling to articulate their issues within the framework of women's human rights and global feminism. I discuss the contradictions and challenges of supporting this work as a non-European antiracist ally who was engaged in a collaborative effort to found the Roma Women's Initiative (RWI) in 1999. The RWI became an operational project of the Soros Foundation/Open Society Institute's Network Women's Program. It provided a model of intersectional feminist practice, led by Romani women in collaboration with non-Romani feminists. Romani women activists are contributing to building a truly inclusive human rights system by challenging the limitations of current frameworks operating in European civil society. They have been on the front lines simultaneously fighting ethnic hatred, racism, sexism, violence against women, educational segregation, poverty, and extreme social exclusion. They do so with limited resources, ambivalent relations with both the mainstream Romani and women's movements, and few role models to call on before them. European Romani women's activism is significant because it seeks to implement intersectional agendas at the level of public policy (e.g., at the level of the nation, the European Union, and the United Nations) and at the level of social movement activism. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

By analysing the coverage of the issue in the main newspapers of four European countries (France, Italy, Spain and the UK) in the two weeks after the new Spanish cabinet was appointed, this article explores the values and ideal roles the media assign to female politicians. The article is based on the premise that mediated representations of female politicians can tell us important things about the relations between gender, power and politics. Such representations embody a set of assumptions about how successful women should look, behave and speak, and thus implicitly express judgments on models of femininity. Ultimately, such representations construct heroines and villains that inform our conceptions of women's political participation, thereby encouraging some forms of gendered political discourse and discouraging others. Our research found that while certain discourses celebrate women ministers for their (symbolic) emancipatory value, others judge them by their physical appearance or their performance as wives, mothers, and mothers-to-be. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","cross-national comparative research; democracy; European press; representation; Women politicians",,"Garcia-Blanco, I.; Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: garcia-blancoi@cardiff.ac.uk",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

The questions posed were: Did national TV news in Israel during the election campaign reflect the changes in the status of women in local politics that have occurred in the last two decades? How prominent was the representation of women politicians in national TV news coverage and what patterns did it display? The sample used in the study consisted of all items dealing with women that were broadcast by one of the national TV stations during the month prior to the local elections. All the news and current affairs broadcasts were analyzed. All items in which women candidates featured, as well as items dealing with issues relating to women in politics in general, were taped and transcribed. The study was based on an interpretive analysis employing the analytical tool of media frames. Although the extent of the coverage of women remained quite meager, this reflects the sociopolitical reality in which women politicians are still a small minority. However, whereas the literature emphasizes the negative stereotypical representation of women politicians, the national TV news representation of women in the local elections was more complex. On the one hand, it mirrored the patriarchal power structure, primarily the subordination of women to men, but on the other hand it also offered a forum for genuine feminist discourse. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","interpretive analysis; Israeli TV news; local politics; media frames; women politicians",,"Lachover, E.; School of Communication, Sapir CollegeIsrael; email: einatl@mail.sapir.ac.il",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

I distinguish contemporary ideas about eventfulness from scripts of media spectacle by locating political eventfulness in the less glamorous, more tedious work of feminist organizing. Drawing on archival records, feminist historical accounts, and print news media coverage of the debate's planning and implementation, I examine the organizational strategies used by the National Action Committee on the Status of Women (NAC) to stage the 1984 federal leaders' debate on women's issues. The negotiations with the political parties over venue, audience constitution, media numbers and NAC's overriding determination to preserve the publicness of the debate demonstrate the ways the women's group approached a long-standing struggle facing feminist organizing within the mainstream: how to accommodate or manage the difference between staging a feminist media event as opposed to a normative media event. Contrary to mainstream media reports which characterized the debate as a boring non-event, I argue that NAC carried out the unprecedented appropriation and transformation of a masculine political ritual into a feminist media event that captured a larger audience share than that year's Stanley Cup ice hockey finals. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Canadian feminist history; feminist eventfulness; media event; National Action Committee on the Status of Women; televised political debate",,"Thrift, S.C.; McGill University's, Department of Art History and Communication Studies, Montréal, Canada; email: samanthathrift@gmail.com",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

While some women read the campaign hegemonically, others resisted its message, even adapting campaign language to suggest alternative plans. Foremost among these, I argue, was Eleanor Roosevelt (ER), whose 1933 book title, It's Up to the Women, is identical to the campaign's slogan. Attributed to ER alone, the slogan has been reprised in twenty-first-century Democratic presidential campaigns and used elsewhere. Patriotic shopping has also reemerged in recent crises. Although less important to feminists, FDR's (Franklin D. Roosevelt) famous fear line from his First Inaugural address resembles language in LHJ's campaign. Thus, the campaign can be seen not only as a site where the contested nature of women's roles was played out but one that illustrates how media language can be repurposed to shape changing cultural and political messages. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","consumer culture; Edward Bernays; Eleanor Roosevelt; Great Depression; public relations; women's magazines",,"Marcellus, J.; Department of Middle, Tennessee State UniversityUnited States; email: jane.marcellus@mtsu.edu",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

Undergraduate women (N = 160) were randomly assigned in groups to read articles either depicting scripts about sexual relationships in a popular women's magazine (experimental) or containing no scripts about sexual relationships in a general entertainment magazine (control). Compared to women in the control group, women who were briefly exposed to a women's magazine were less likely to believe that sexual intercourse is a risky activity and more likely to believe that women should be assertive in prioritizing their sexual desire for their own sake, but not for a male partner's. Individual and cultural differences in women's acceptance of magazines' sexual scripts also emerged based on factors such as regular frequency of magazine reading, level of sexual experience, and ethnic background. Our results suggest that the complex and sometimes conflicting representations of female sexuality proliferating in the mass media and popular culture could potentially have both empowering and problematic effects on women's developing sexual identities. © The Author(s) 2012.","mass media; popular culture; role expectations; sex role attitudes; sexual attitudes; sexual risk-taking; sexual satisfaction",,"Kim, J.

Our study examined the differences in risk factors of suicidal ideation between 99 African American and 529 European American college women (18-24 years old). The only significant difference that was reported between the two groups of women was on hopelessness, with African American women having lower hopelessness scores. In hierarchical regression analyses, reports of hopelessness, depression, and perceived burdensomeness, but not thwarted belongingness, significantly predicted suicidal ideation in college women. Furthermore, race moderated the relationship between hopelessness and suicidal ideation such that hopelessness was a stronger predictor for African American women than it was for European American women. Race also moderated the depression-suicidal ideation association, with depression emerging as a stronger predictor of suicidal ideation for European American than for African American women. When assessing risk for suicide, our results suggest that practitioners may need to focus more on hopelessness in African American women and more on depression in European American women while also considering perceived burdensomeness in college women regardless of race.

These discourses mobilized doubt about the relationship as abusive and limited sympathy for the accused as a battered woman. Judges' descriptions formulated domestic abuse as discrete episodes of violence, attributed in many cases to alcohol rather than to an ongoing pattern of serious domestic abuse. These descriptions reinforced the accused's capabilities and strength, which served to diminish the opposing claim that she was trapped in a seriously abusive relationship.

Conversely, participants reporting positive changes experienced new employment opportunities, a greater sense of perspective, and high levels of effective communication and support in their relationships.

In contrast, stereotypes and issues of well-being (regarding women's roles), and social conventions (regarding men's traditional roles) were used to support the maintenance of traditional role divisions. The results have implications for educators and policy makers and are discussed with a focus on how attitudes about family roles may be changed most effectively to increase egalitarian attitudes. Implications for the measurement of gender-role attitudes are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2012.","division of labor; family work relationship; racial and ethnic differences; sex role attitudes; sex roles; social cognitive domain theory",,"Gere, J.; Department of Psychology, University of Toronto, 100 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G3, Canada; email: judith.gere@utoronto.ca",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

The authors tested a model that examined whether staking self-worth in certain domains was associated with decreased or increased body surveillance and appearance satisfaction in a sample of 115 Black and 222 White college women. Results indicated that investing self-worth in appearance and approval from others was associated with increased body surveillance and reduced appearance satisfaction whereas self-worth based in academic competence, God's love, and family support was associated with less body surveillance and more appearance satisfaction. Tests of racial differences revealed that our model operated similarly across race. However, the structural paths of appearance contingency to body surveillance, academic competence contingency to body surveillance, and family support contingency to appearance satisfaction were stronger for White than Black women. This work outlines potential strategies to counteract body surveillance and appearance dissatisfaction by emphasizing domains of self-worth that are not appearance based and are staked in love and support.

Has psychology heeded these calls? The authors investigated this question using the subfield of personality as an exemplar. Based on a systematic analysis of publication trends in nine prominent journals, the authors found that social-structural analyses rarely appear in highly cited journals specifically devoted to personality research. Instead, these analyses appear in journals that focus on certain social structures (gender and race/ethnicity), while still neglecting others (social class and sexual orientation). To illustrate how greater attention to social structure can advance the scientific understanding of individuals, the authors then identified specific research programs that look closely at both personality and structure. The article concludes with specific recommendations for research and teaching in personality psychology, gender and race psychology, and beyond. © The Author(s) 2012.","experimental subjects; methodology; personality; racial and ethnic groups; sex roles; sexual orientation; social class; social groups; social structure; teaching",,"Cortina, L.

In the current study, we sought to examine whether these nonlabeling women fall into two distinct groups: (a) one that falls on the same ideological continuum of their feminist peers and (b) the other that represents an attitudinally unique group of women characterized by their neoliberal beliefs that prioritize individual merit as the sole determinant of success. Two samples of undergraduate women self-reported their feminist identity and political and sexist attitudes. In our first sample (N = 231), we used k-means cluster analysis to identify two types of nonlabelers: quasi-feminists and neoliberals. Results revealed that, despite both groups' shared belief in gender equality, quasi-feminists reported relatively lower levels of meritocratic, just world, and modern sexist beliefs, all of which were similar to those of their feminist-identified peers, whereas neoliberals indicated stronger meritocratic, just world, and modern sexist beliefs. In our second sample (N = 351), we replicated findings from our first sample and subsequently validated these groupings. Specifically, multivariate analysis of variance results demonstrated that, separate from the differences found in relation to the measures used for cluster analysis, quasi-feminists scored lower than neoliberals on measures of ambivalent sexism, social dominance, and equal opportunity beliefs. Women's individual and collective welfare often hinges on their endorsement of neoliberal and feminist beliefs, especially in the face of unfair treatment. We suggest that activists and policy makers tailor strategies for engaging nonlabelers in the movement toward gender equality to the subtype of nonlabeler in question. © The Author(s) 2012.","activism; equity (social); feminism; sex role attitudes; sexism; social change; social justice",,"Fitz, C.

Utilizing cross-sectional data from 236 male police officers in South Korea, results of structural equation modeling indicated that attitudes toward women and rape survivor myths were positively related to rape perceptions. Those who had stereotypical attitudes toward women and those who had stronger beliefs in rape survivor myths were more likely to endorse rape-supportive attributions in rape scenarios. Results also revealed that officers' attitudes toward women were indirectly related to rape perceptions through rape survivor myths. Moreover, previous attendance at a sexual assault educational program was inversely related to rape perceptions, such that those who attended an educational program were less likely to endorse rape-supportive attributions in rape scenarios.

This study provides a first step in conceptualizing the measurement of women's aggression by examining how well three widely used measures (i.e., the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS), the Sexual Experiences Survey [SES], and the Psychological Maltreatment of Women Inventory [PMWI]) perform in assessing women's perpetration of and victimization by aggression in their intimate relationships with men. These constructs were examined in a diverse sample of 412 African American, Latina, and White women who had all recently used physical aggression against a male intimate partner. The factor structures and psychometric properties of perpetration and victimization models using these measures were compared. Results indicate that the factor structure of women's perpetration differs from that of women's victimization in theoretically meaningful ways. In the victimization model, all factors performed well in contributing to the measurement of the latent victimization construct. In contrast, the perpetration model performed well in assessing women's physical and psychological aggression but performed poorly in assessing women's sexual aggression, coercive control, and jealous monitoring. Findings suggest that the power and control model of intimate partner violence (IPV) may apply well to women's victimization but not as well to their perpetration of violence. © The Author(s) 2012.","measurement of women's aggression; women's aggression","African American; aggression; article; Caucasian; evaluation; factorial analysis; female; Hispanic; human; human relation; jealousy; male; partner violence; persuasive communication; psychological aspect; sexuality; victim; violence; African Americans; Aggression; Coercion; Crime Victims; European Continental Ancestry Group; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Jealousy; Male; Men; Sexual Partners; Spouse Abuse; Violence; Women","Swan, S.

S. In Study 1, 242 Hispanic undergraduates were asked to describe their most recent first romantic encounter using a cognitive script methodology, and then to classify the encounter as being a date, hangout, hookup, one-night stand, or other type of encounter. Encounters were most frequently classified as a date, followed by hangouts; very few individuals indicated that their most recent encounter was a hookup or one-night stand. Dates were described as highly gender stereotypic, with men performing significantly more actions overall than women. The date script also included more gender-typed actions, was more structured, and was considered more ideal than a hangout. In Study 2, a checklist of 60 actions derived from Study 1 was used to assess the most recent initial romantic encounters of 217 Hispanic undergraduates. Dates were reported most frequently, followed by hangouts. Dates continued to be highly gender stereotyped with men being responsible for more actions than women, and the date script continued to include more gender-typed actions than the hangout. A date was also more structured and rated as more ideal and satisfying than a hangout. The predominance of and preference for dates, the most gender-typed way for young adults to get together romantically, was consistent with Hispanic cultural norms that support traditional gender roles. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Dating; Gender; Hangout; Heterosexual; Hispanic; Hookup; Scripts; Sexual scripts; Social dating; Young adults",,"Eaton, A.

Forty-seven men from the United States completed measures that assessed masculinity ideology, the importance of the partner's greater income, and romantic relationship quality. We examined whether the perceived importance of the income disparity mediated the relationship between men's masculinity ideology and the quality of their romantic relationships. Using multiple regression analyses to test for mediation, results showed the relationship between masculinity ideology and romantic relationship quality was due in part to the importance one placed on the difference in income. Specifically, men who were more traditional in their masculinity ideology and have higher earning female partners were more likely to have poor quality romantic relationships in part because such men view the disparity in income as having importance. Conversely, results showed men who were more nontraditional in their masculinity were more likely to perceive the disparity in income as having little or no importance and have high romantic relationship quality. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Breadwinner role; Marital quality; Masculinity; Relationship satisfaction; Romantic relationship",,"Wade, J.

Furthermore, much of the research tends to be descriptive in nature. As a consequence, little is known about the association of postpartum body satisfaction and intimacy in first-time mothers and fathers. The current study interviewed 85 heterosexual married/cohabiting couples from all over the U. S. 9 months following the birth of their first child. New mothers reported significantly less postpartum body and intimacy satisfaction than new fathers. Using an actor-partner interdependence model approach, we found that fathers' self and partner body satisfaction are both directly and indirectly (through his perceived partner rejection) linked to his intimacy satisfaction. For mothers, partner and self-body satisfaction were only indirectly linked to her intimacy satisfaction through perceived partner rejection of sexual advances. Finally, fathers' perceived partner rejection was related to both his and his partner's intimacy satisfaction. These results suggest that body and intimacy satisfaction following the birth of a child is not only relevant for mothers but also for fathers. In order to better understand how the transition to parenthood impacts couples and their relationship, future theory and research needs to incorporate fathers and their understanding of their bodies and its connection with postpartum intimacy. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body satisfaction; First-time mothers and fathers; Postpartum intimacy",,"Mickelson, K.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between men's pornography use, both frequency and problematic use, on their heterosexual female partner's psychological and relational well-being among 308 young adult college women. In addition, psychometric properties for the Perceived Partner's Pornography Use Scale are provided. Participants were recruited at a large Southern public university in the United States and completed an online survey. Results revealed women's reports of their male partner's frequency of pornography use were negatively associated with their relationship quality. More perceptions of problematic use of pornography was negatively correlated with self-esteem, relationship quality, and sexual satisfaction. In addition, self-esteem partially mediated the relationship between perceptions of partner's problematic pornography use and relationship quality. Finally, results revealed that relationship length moderated the relationship between perceptions of partner's problematic pornography use and sexual satisfaction, with significant dissatisfaction being associated with longer relationship length. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Pornography; Relationship quality; Scale; Self-esteem; Sexual satisfaction",,"Stewart, D.

It is unknown, however, which sexual minority women are most likely to experience such abuse. We recruited adult sexual minority women living in the US through electronic fliers sent to listservs and website groups inviting them to complete an online survey (N = 1,243). We examined differences in both childhood abuse and adult sexual assault by women's current gender identity (i. e., butch, femme, androgynous, or other) and a continuous measure of gender expression (from butch/masculine to femme/feminine), adjusting for sexual orientation identity, age, education, and income. Results indicated that a more butch/masculine current self-assessment of gender expression, but not gender identity, was associated with more overall reported childhood trauma. Although one aspect of gender expression, a more butch/masculine gender role, was associated with adult sexual assault, feminine appearance and a femme gender identity also significantly predicted adult sexual assault. These findings highlight the significance of gender identity and expression in identifying women at greater risk for various abuse experiences. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Bisexual; Butch/femme; Childhood abuse; Gender expression; Gender identity; Lesbian; Sexual assault",,"Lehavot, K.; VA Puget Sound Health Care System, 1660 S.

The current study aimed to fill an important gap in the literature by identifying several social-environmental factors that may be associated with dispositional authenticity-""the unobstructed operation of one's core or true self in one's daily enterprise"" (Kernis and Goldman 2006, p. 294)-and determining whether these factors differ for males and females. Theoretical links between dispositional authenticity and perceptions of close relationship partners as more authentic and egalitarian were empirically examined. This study expanded on relational authenticity research, which has linked behaving authentically in relationships to higher self-esteem and less depressive symptomatology, to address whether females are more likely than males to display dispositional authenticity, as well as to report low self-esteem and depression when they engage in inauthenticity. Participants were 470 U. S. college students (318 female) who were recruited from colleges across the country (41 % from a liberal arts school, 31 % from a large public university) and completed questionnaires online. Path analysis indicated that both genders report more authenticity when they perceived their mothers to be more authentic; authenticity, in turn, was related to fewer depressive symptoms and greater self-esteem for both genders. For females only, authenticity was also positively related to the perceived authenticity of important nonparental adults, and a more traditional gender ideology was related to higher self-esteem; for males only, depressive symptoms were positively related to a more traditional gender ideology.

Transgender women in the United States are nearly 6 times more likely than the general population to experience significant depressive symptoms. Studies among non-transgender individuals in the United States demonstrate that agentic traits are associated with less depressive symptoms, while studies on communal traits are more inconsistent in their association with indicators of depression. Our study's central objective was to examine the associations of agency and communion with depression and resilience (i. e., personal competence and acceptance of self and life) among transgender women living part-time and full-time in the female gender role. Participants in the United States were recruited through online and offline purposive sampling. One hundred and twenty-two transgender women (primarily Caucasian; ages ranging from 22 to 75) completed a web-based questionnaire. Results indicated that agentic and communal traits were significantly associated with decreased symptoms of depression and increased levels of resilience. One component of resilience - acceptance of self and life - mediated the relationship between agentic/communal traits and depression, however, for communal traits this pattern was only found for transgender women living in the female role full-time. There were no significant differences on depressive symptoms and one component of resilience - personal competence - among transgender women living full-time compared to transgender women living in the female role part-time. Transgender women living full-time in the female gender role reported higher levels of agentic/communal traits and acceptance of self and life compared to those living part-time in the female gender role.

Its power “to wrench frames” is what I am posing to intersectional research, not only to reflect on what intersectionality has allowed feminists to accomplish but also to identify some existing shortcomings in the scope and domain of its employment. Because there is little disputing intersectionality's theoretical contribution to feminist research in the past decades—one scholar calls it “the most important theoretical contribution that women's studies has made so far” (McCall 2005, 1771)—it is important for us to take stock of the sorts of political problems that intersectional scholarship has addressed and the ones to which it has often been inattentive. © 2012, The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association.

We are concerned that “sexuality” as an identity used in intersectional analysis is perhaps overly reductive, sometimes telling nothing more than whether someone is “straight” or “gay,” rather than leaving room to interrogate the complicated, diverse landscape that is at the intersection of gender, sex, and sexuality. In this essay, we apply a queer-theory critique of intersectionality to demonstrate how human-trafficking policy, particularly as it relates to sex trafficking, is productive of what Valentine (2007) calls culturally constructed and deployed identity categories, resulting in inclusion of some and exclusion of others.

The broader influence of neoliberalism and post-neoliberalism (also known as the social-investment perspective) in Canada has amplified this trend. Global trends toward neoliberalism encouraged less state involvement and reduced public spending on the welfare state from the 1980s into the 1990s, with detrimental effects on women's policy. Moreover, feminist women's groups and women's issues were increasingly labeled “special interests”; advocacy claims toward the state were routinely delegitimized by successive provincial and federal governments, although this trend was less pronounced under left-wing regimes than right-wing ones (Collier 2006; 2009). As Canada entered the new millennium, many social-policy researchers identified a renewed state interest in reinvestment in social programs to position the state better in a competitive global marketplace. This newer shift toward the “social-investment perspective” is alleged to have consciously erased gender from social policy debates, particularly in the child-care arena (see Jenson 2009). © 2012, The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association.

In 1957, Aaron was tortured and castrated at the hands of several members of the Ku Klux Klan of the Confederacy in an attempt to send a threatening message to black Civil Rights activists. At the conclusion of the panel, a male audience member asked, “Was he [Judge Aaron] raped?” I was stunned by this question; to me, it seemed obvious that Aaron had been sexually violated, at the very least, and my answer relayed my sense of the events as a sexual crime. It was clear, however, that this man, like many others, read the violation of Aaron, and many other black men, as being some other class of crime. In the absence of penetrative sex, he could not frame Aaron's assault as a sexual crime. In part, this is because in the absence of penetration, we do not generally read the male body as vulnerable and open to sexual abuse in the same way as the female body. For obvious reasons, lynching is bound up with sex. The narrative of the “black male rapist” is quite pervasive. Nevertheless, we tend to default to an almost exclusively racial lens when viewing lynching. This essay does not aim to displace this idea but to make a critical intervention in the conversation by suggesting that lynching can be understood as a type of racialized, sexual violence that uniquely harms black men. © 2012, The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association.

Deal, Leadership Orientations Instrument, Jossey-Bass, San Francisco, 1990), focus groups utilizing the Midwest Flood Problem (Atman et al., J. Eng. Educ., vol. 24, no. 2, pp. 234-245, 2008) and individual interviews. The study concludes that male and female students might have different understandings or perceptions of what ""leadership"" means. While men preferred the structural leadership frame and women preferred the human resource leadership frame, more detailed information about this differentiation became apparent with the inclusion of the qualitative data. For male students in this study, leading was more about directing teamwork, running meetings, and project oversight. For female students, leading was about facilitating collaboration among team members, being responsible, and contributing to the team. These findings show that more development of students as leaders working in teams needs to happen during the collegiate engineering experience, as a majority of students are not able to utilize multiple leadership frames in a situation, which is necessary when working on complex and cutting-edge engineering problems. © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.","Engineering teams; Gender; Leadership",,"Rowan-Kenyon, H.

Participants were 141 female adolescents (M = 14. 45 years at Time 1) from Adelaide, South Australia, who completed questionnaires at two time points, approximately 1 year apart. Self-report measures of menarcheal status and onset of menarche, time spent on organised sports, self-objectification, body shame and disordered eating were completed at both time points. Time since menarche was not shown to relate to self-objectification. However, correlations and structural equation modelling revealed that amount of sport was negatively related to later self-objectification. That is, time spent playing sport was predictive of lower self-objectification 1 year later. In addition, the model of objectification was confirmed at two time points providing important evidence for the stability of the model during adolescence. The results provide the first empirical evidence for sport as a potential protective factor to the development of self-objectification in adolescence and provide an important practical suggestion for one way in which girls can attempt to alleviate the development of self-objectification and its harmful consequences. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescence; Longitudinal; Pubertal development; Self-objectification; Sport participation",,"Slater, A.; School of Psychology, Flinders University, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; email: amy.slater@flinders.edu.au",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867518240

This paper uses a multivariate regression model to examine the association between gender on the audit committee and the number of audit committee meetings used as a proxy for audit committee diligence. The paper uses a sample of 254 firms from the S&P SmallCap600, with a December 31, 2003 fiscal yearend. The author finds consistent evidence to show that audit committees with at least one female director were likely to meet more often than allmale audit committees. Future research suggests that it may be fruitful to examine the effects of gender on other aspects of audit committee and board activities and the interaction between audit committees, management, and the external auditor. Furthermore, the results of the paper have strong implications for regulators and policy makers, since the presence of a female director on the audit committee may bring many positive outcomes, thereby leading to better corporate governance practices. Hence, the appointment of more females on the audit committee should be strongly emphasized. This research paper contributes to the contemporary literature regarding the increased awareness of good outcomes associated with having women on the audit committee in various ways. First, this research encourages the appointment of more females on the audit committee. Second, increased diligence of the audit committee leads to enhanced corporate governance practices. Third, the presence of females on the audit committee could lead to good corporate decision making. Fourth, the presence of a female on the audit committee could lead to increased confidence of the public. Fifth, this research also serves as an influencing power to encourage equal opportunities for both men and women. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Audit committee; Audit committee diligence; Auditing; Corporate governance; Female; Meetings; Women directors",,"Thiruvadi, S.; Department of Accounting, School of Business and Management, Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865720271

Regression results revealed that for both women and men, trust and peer influence were significant predictors of covert fidelity management behavior. However, self-esteem was a significant predictor of men's covert fidelity management, not women's. Furthermore, covert fidelity management was found not related to women's relationship satisfaction, but was significantly associated with men's satisfaction in a negative direction.

This act represents a victory for a group historically discriminated for its sexual preferences and until then absent from the national legislation. In this context, in appearance so favourable to sexual equality, I believe this new law does not match the sexual order that today regulates the bodies of Argentine women. As from 1920 abortion is illegal in Argentina and it is reckoned as a crime against human life. Nevertheless, abortion is still the major cause of death among women in this country. Given this situation, in this article I will analyze the gap I find between homosexual and reproductive politics in the country. Unlike Europe, where reproductive rights preceded homosexual rights, in Argentina the opposite situation is observed. In this country, the legal recognition of same sex couples matches measures taken by other democracies and aimed at reaching what certain authors call sexual citizenship. Nevertheless, as long as Argentina does not recognize the right to free and safe abortion, this notion, which legitimates the universal applicability of sexual rights, will continue to be problematic.

From the perspective of gender we discuss the boundaries that have been constructed between the collective space of citizenship and sociability and the individual space of intimacy and inequality. We make a case for a relationship of complicity, albeit tense, between the two spheres, observing that private life has been extensively moulded by the changes that have taken place in public life. Making use of the different definitions of 'public', we note that as the traditional, essentially masculine, sociabilities studied by Ariès or Sennett, among others, were eroded, the sense of intimacy increased. There was also greater inclusion of the private in the public through the expansion of citizenship, following the battles fought in the public sphere by various emancipation movements, e.g. those of the workers or the feminists. As individuals were taken out of the community, clan or family group, where the inequalities were ""natural"", in the Aristotelian sense of the term, they progressively rediscovered themselves as individuals endowed with citizenship. If the private space has become of central importance in the definition of an identity, it is also increasingly crossed by public, regulatory mechanisms. For this reason, the ascent of the private, which has been a topic of debate in recent decades, should be carefully reinterpreted. © 2012 by Revista Estudos Feministas.","Equality; Feminism; Gender; Modernity; Public/Private",,"Aboim, S.; Universidade de LisboaPortugal",,,0104026X,,,,"Portuguese","Rev.

To understand how gender identities are interactionally negotiated, and here considering specifically the aspects related to maternity, I present the importance of Conversation Analysis, through the qualitative analysis of naturalistic interactions between a psychologist and candidates for vasectomy and tubal ligation, which occurred at a public health center in the south of Brazil.

We examined whether changes in written language, especially the ratio of male to female pronouns, reflected these trends in status in the full text of nearly 1. 2 million U. S. books 1900-2008 from the Google Books database. Male pronouns included he, him, his, himself and female pronouns included she, her, hers, and herself. Between 1900 and 1945, 3. 5 male pronouns appeared for every female pronoun, increasing to 4. 5 male pronouns during the postwar era of the 1950s and early 1960s. After 1968, the ratio dropped precipitously, reaching 2 male pronouns per female pronoun by the 2000s. From 1968 to 2008, the use of male pronouns decreased as female pronouns increased. The gender pronoun ratio was significantly correlated with indicators of U. S. women's status such as educational attainment, labor force participation, and age at first marriage as well as women's assertiveness, a personality trait linked to status. Books used relatively more female pronouns when women's status was high and fewer when it was low. The results suggest that cultural products such as books mirror U.

Design/methodology/approach: A structural equation analysis of anxiety and depression with aspects of precariousness of life as model predictors was explored with t-test and correlation analyses used to explore gender differences in the study variables. Findings: The structural equation model produced strong evidence to suggest that precariousness of life was a significant predictor of both anxiety and depression. Women reported significantly higher scores than men on distrust toward the professional future and the emotional consequences on everyday life, anxiety and depression. As hypothesized, the negative consequences of temporary work in personal and family life appear more evident in women.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 612 manager/non-manager dyads with all non-managers being female. The organization was located in the Northwest section of the United States and was a large Fortune 500 manufacturing firm. All levels of the organization were utilized from entry level positions to vice presidents to measure how women fared under female vs male mentors. Findings: Women with female mentor supervisors earn less than with male mentor supervisors. The disparity is even greater the younger the protégée. If the trend shown in this research continues, wages may drop for women in high levels of the organization with same- sex mentees. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this research is the operationalization of a manager as a mentor. Supervisors were used as the mentor in most examples. Even if the participants in the study had self-selected their mentors, it would still be expected that the participants would be successful. Another limitation to this research is that there was no direct assessment of the perceptions of the mentor/protégé relationship among the participants. More research needs to be done to understand why these trends were found which might include looking at personality traits, various characteristics, immutable traits, etc. Additionally, experimental longitudinal research should be done to arrive at a definitive conclusion. This research provides the impetus to study the phenomenon cross culturally, outside of the northwest and outside of the USA, etc. Practical implications: The practical implications for management may be that having women moving up the organizational hierarchy without the appropriate pay increase may save the company money in labor costs. But, as women recognize the disparity in income, they may request opposite sex mentors vs same sex mentors which may be a self-limiting factor for organizations promoting women into higher level positions in the organization. Therefore, they may promote fewer women which would decrease their diversity efforts. Originality/value: Many researchers have reviewed the relationship between a mentee and a more seasoned organizational member. Formal and informal mentoring systems have been studied as well reviewing many variables. The research reviewing same vs opposite sex pairings in the mentor/protégé relationship demonstrates conflicting findings.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual paper that argues for the convergence of the entrepreneurship and leadership fields to enable an interchange of ideas, and learn from the developments within each field from a gender perspective. Whilst scholars have recently begun to explore the concept of entrepreneurial leadership, these early developments have remained gender blind, gender defensive and gender neutral. Findings: A central argument is that female entrepreneur leader's experience social role incongruity. In order to be perceived by their followers as credible and legitimate entrepreneurial leaders, women are expected to manage their dual presence across the symbolic spaces of femininity and masculinity, doing gender well and doing gender differently to meet social role expectations of being a woman, whilst also meeting dominant masculine constructions of leadership and entrepreneurship. Practical implications: This paper extends understandings of entrepreneurial leadership, highlighting the importance of foregrounding gender, to make visible and integrate the historical developments of gender within the entrepreneurship and leadership fields. Both scholars and practitioners must ""unlearn"" and ""rethink"" our learnt state of being in relation to gender, leadership and entrepreneurship in order to move beyond the ""given"" and disrupt masculinities' hierarchical superiority. Originality/value: The paper argues that blends of agentic and communal behaviours must be recognized as accessible to both women and men for effective entrepreneurial leadership. This will provide female entrepreneurial leaders the fluidity to do both and be something else as a person. Offering understandings of gender to extant gender blind, gender neutral and gender defensive constructions of entrepreneurial leadership will progress understandings of the framework emerging from this conceptualization. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial leadership; Entrepreneurialism; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Leadership; Women",,"Patterson, N.; Newcastle Business School, Northumbria University, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, United Kingdom; email: nicola.patterson@northumbria.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865801960

A country of almost 50 million people, South Africa has a diverse array of languages, races, religions and ethnic communities, and has faced significant challenges - political, cultural and socio-economic - since the advent of democracy in 1994. The writers of the 1996 Constitution faced the unenviable task of accommodating the diverse viewpoints that inevitably derived from South Africa's fractured history and society. The Constitution is one of the most progressive in the world, and notably includes a Bill of Rights, which in addition to including civil and political rights typically protected by international human rights instruments, includes protection of socio-economic and cultural rights. Cultural rights are protected in Sections 30 and 31 of the Constitution, although such protection is not without limitation. This highly complex interplay and ""competition"" between human rights and culture is the golden thread that traces through the paper, which focuses on several cultural practices and traditions which, it is suggested, violate certain human rights norms in South Africa. These practices and traditions, all of which relate to women, are reviewed - together with the sections of the South African Constitution that they are considered to violate. Using the example of curbing the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in other African countries through the NGO Tostan, it is emphasized that the law is only one component of a multidisciplinary approach, and that civil society, government and other role-players are all needed to change perceptions and attitudes. In conclusion, general recommendations are made about reducing the conflict between culture and human rights in South Africa. These include the use of human rights education, human rights advocacy on gender issues, legislative measures, and developing customary law to ensure compatibility with the South African Constitution.","Culture and human rights; Human rights; South Africa",,"Mubangizi, J.C.; College of Law and Management Studies, University of KwaZulu-NatalSouth Africa",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Small scale mining is a significant source of income in many developing countries such as the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Bolivia, Colombia, Indonesia, Mali, and Zimbabwe. In the Philippines, small-scale mining has been the leading occupational group among all mineral industries. However, data show that women face many issues in mining such as double burden of work-home responsibilities, chemical exposure to either cyanide or mercury used in extracting gold, dust from manganese and other minerals, and respiratory and systemic diseases from toxic chemical exposures. Mining work is also labor-intensive and hazardous. Women work longer hours and have no social safety net. Gender sensitive strategies on occupational health and safety of women in small scale mining should be implemented. For long term development goals, women should be given alternative and more environmentally sustainable forms of employment. Gender equality and equity should always accompany any policy response as the impact goes beyond the employment and labour sector, to the overall stability of society considering the varied roles and functions that women take in both the public and private spheres of life.","Artisanal mining; Occupational health and safety; Policy directives in mining; Small scale mining; Women in mining",,"Lu, J.L.; Institute of Health Policy and Development Studies, Environmental and Occupational Health Study Group, National Institutes of Health, University of the PhilippinesPhilippines; email: jinky_lu@yahoo.com",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

An un-weighted sample of 2215 women aged 15-49, who have had sexual intercourse was considered for analysis. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses are used to gain insights into the potential linkages between economic status, education and risky sexual behavior. The bivariate analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between dependent variable (number of sexual partners) and economic status. However, with the introduction of controls the significant relationship persisted. The findings also show that the married and the living together had a significantly higher chance of having more than one sexual partner compared to the Not married. However, with the introduction of controls the significant relationship that existed between economic status and having had sexual intercourse in exchange for money/gifts disappeared. Moreover, women who believed that an HIV mother can avoid transmission to the baby appeared to have a significantly higher chance of having sexual intercourse in exchange for money/gifts than those who did not believe that an HIV mother can avoid transmission to the baby. Lastly this study revealed that inconsistent condom use is neither a function of economic status nor education, as well as the following socioeconomic environments; age, marital status, religion and awareness/knowledge on avoiding HIV transmission from a mother to a baby.

The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have witnessed historically unprecedented levels of violence against non-combatants as well as a concomitant rise in international and local efforts to assist survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. Yet the diversity of cultural contexts in which SGBV occurs challenges us to ask a timely question: what might a transnational feminist analysis of conflict-related sexual violence look like? This is particularly salient because feminist scholar-activists increasingly help shape policy designed to both address sexual violence as a weapon or by-product of war and services to assist its survivors. This article addresses the rise of global and local initiatives and institutions that rely upon the relatively recent emergence of concretized ""best practices"" recommended as global solutions to what are inevitably local problems. This article demonstrates how such global solutions are recommended for what are inevitably local problems and exemplifies how best practices are couched in human rights discourses that are presumed universally relevant despite their almost exclusive origination and dissemination by individuals in a privileged position vis-à-vis the intended beneficiaries of such discourse's practice. After analyzing the ethical concerns raised by this reality, this article proposes using non-hegemonic feminist models to develop new strategies for respecting both cultural diversity and the humanitarian responsibility to protect individuals from conflict-related sexual violence.","International law; Rape; Sexual violence",,"Dewey, S.; Gender and Women's Studies, University of WyomingUnited States; email: sdewey3@uwyo.edu",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

In what ways do these women choose to transmit their memories to the next generation? These are the questions explored in this study. Women immigrants have been treated as if they were insignificant actors in history and socialization (Kelson & DeLaet, 1999). Feminist scholarship challenges this portrait of women as insignificant actors, arguing against gender-biased perspectives on the immigration experience. Yet scholarly sources provide little information about the ""real life problems"" of women immigrants (Barber, 2005). Immigration research historically has tended toward historical and demographical data compilations, resulting in a database devoid of personal voice or lived experience (Errante, 2000; Heinemann, 1996). Researchers have largely ignored women immigrants' stories. Studying contemporary European immigrant women's narratives of wartime experience can provide scholars with fresh perspectives on the World War II era. This article draws from both the feminist framework and oral history research methodology to record and analyze European immigrant women's experiences with and memories of war and to illuminate scholars' understanding of women as civilians during times of war. The researcher recounts 10 European women's experiences of and memories about World War II. The study adds to the available literature by considering women's experiences of war, as told by women, and as passed down to successive generations.","Immigration; Oral history; World War II",,"Hickey, G.; College of Education and Public Policy, Indiana University-Purdue University Fort, Wayne, IN, United States; email: hickey@ipfw.edu",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

In Indonesia, the family structure is inherently patriarchal and hierarchical in nature, one which exhorts wives to stay at home while husbands are seen as breadwinners and whose roles are non-domestic. However, women are doubly marginalized in Indonesia as their subordinate status in the domestic space is reified at the national level through the state ideology of the nation as a-united and inclusive family"". Moreover, using the doctrine of Ibuism, or Motherhood, the government encourages women to stay at home and conform to the ideal roles of wife and mother, thereby restricting their rights as citizens. Using Benedict Anderson's theory of the nation as an-imagined political community"", I will consider how Love for Share ideologically constructs and imaginatively situates its characters as gendered subjects in the spaces of family and nation through the representations of polygamy, and how the film imagines and expresses female desire, agency and freedom.

Duncan Jones, 2009). Drawing on Joan Tronto's work (1993), I delineate a conventional, vernacular conception of care, which puts in place problematic, prescriptive roles in caring relationships. Then, reading Moon through Donna Haraway's theorisation of companion species (2008) and what she terms the 'touching' of material histories and contingencies, I show how these hierarchies may be unravelled. This figure of the caring computer represents a capacity for affective impact upon human subjects that is not normally ascribed to 'emotionless' technological subjects. It animates a disruption of the linear, instrumental relationships of power between humans and technologies by showing the ways in which ongoing processes of co-constitution are responsible for bringing each participant in the relationship into being. Care here is a manner of activating and making conspicuous those processes and can unravel, rather than prescribe, the roles which respective participants in such relationships are assigned. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","care; clone; companion species; figures; film; robot; suffering; technology",,"Stoate, R.; Newcastle University, School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, Percy Building, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, United Kingdom; email: robin.stoate@ncl.ac.uk",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Beyond the confines of the experiential and the positivist, both psychoanalysis and deconstruction provide insights into affect as a technology that understands the subject as porous. I consider works by Derek Jarman and Shirin Neshat to demonstrate the importance of the ethico-politics of affect as interface in contemporary cultural production. Both artists, in the process of considering the spectacular nature of notions of feminist and queer, use images of interface as a way of delimiting the spectacular nature of being and demonstrating the singularity of the event, the desire to fix through framing, and the parergonal nature of framing. The presence of the subject is questioned even as an auto-affection is suggestive of a spectral demand of the ethico-political. In the case of Jarman's Blue, the denial of image as face in favour of the screen as interface is interrupted by sound and voice, which gesture toward representation as impossible but necessary. In the case of Neshat, the persistence of the photographic - the highly aesthetic self-portrait as mugshot - foregrounds face as interface, as one that questions presence through the insistence of a representational apparatus. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","affect; anxiety; auto-affection; interface; melancholia",,"Khanna, R.; Women's Studies Program, Duke University, 210 East Duke Building, Campus Box 90760, Durham, NC 27708, United States; email: ranjana.khanna@duke.edu",,,14647001,,,,"English","Fem.

Combining scholarly investigation and personal memoir, Saidiya Hartman's Lose Your Mother exemplifies feminism's affective turn not only by bringing personal narrative into scholarship, but by seeking reparation for the past in the affective dynamics of cultural memory rather than in legal reform or state recognition. Stubbornly refusing to find solace in an African past before slavery, though, Hartman provides a model of emotional reparation in which feelings of loss and alienation persist.

While few men are likely to subscribe to archetypal masculine roles or stereotypes, ethnographic research with adult male prisoners revealed that individuals endeavored to fit in and become socially accepted into the prison community, commonly aligning themselves with normative values, attitudes, and behaviors of prison life, and striving for social legitimacy. ""Front management"" strategies were employed by individuals to convey ""masculine"" personas consistent with the prison code, a system of values based on aggression, violence, control, and exploitation-or ""dog eat dog"" and ""divide and rule""-where individuals would become situated within the hegemonic social hierarchy. Participants equated emotional, psychological, and social survival with health and well-being, which was in turn dependent in part on their social status and legitimacy.

Despite convincing arguments in favour of utilizing these methods, they are still largely absent in the heartland of gender studies. In this article, this is related to the observation that methods are tied to epistemological positions and consequently quantitative studies are a priori associated with overgeneralization. A new perspective - the diversity continuum - is presented in order to contextualize research and make it possible to judge it relatively. This shows that quantitative research can increase the understanding of differences and similarities. Subsequently, it is discussed how quantitative research can be utilized to understand differences between people using existing basic techniques. In line with the conceptualization of diversity, this includes techniques to study intersectionality and how developments have different effects on men and women. The continuum and techniques are illustrated by an example of political interest (in the Dominican Republic). © The Author(s) 2012.","Diversity; feminist methods; gender studies; intersectionality; quantitative research; regression analysis; statistics",,"Spierings, N.; Radboud University, Institute for Management Research, Departments of Political Science and Economics, Thomas van Aquinostraat 5.01.78, PO Box 9108, 6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; email: n.spierings@fm.ru.nl",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

By explaining the theoretical framework of the 'middle' Foucault (governmentality and agency) and the 'later' Foucault (ethics and agency) and then comparing Mahmood and Heyes' use of Foucault's work, it is argued that Mahmood and Heyes' analyses, though thought-provoking and incisive, overlook aspects of Foucault's later work, ultimately preventing them from offering productive 'feminist strategies'. The author seeks to link this discussion to contemporary debates and analyses of agency, freedom and Muslim women in the media. The article concludes with an assessment of how Foucauldian feminist perspectives might be drawn on to establish effective 'cross-cultural feminist strategies', and closes by presenting a case of a cross-cultural media strategy aimed at countering the stereotypical images of Muslim women in the media. © The Author(s) 2012.","Agency; beauty culture; Cressida Heyes; cross-cultural feminism; feminist (media) strategies; Foucauldian ethics; freedom practices; governmentality; media; Muslim women; Saba Mahmood",,"Vintges, K.; University of Amsterdam, Department of Philosophy, Oude Turfmarkt 141-147, NL 1012 GC Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: k.v.q.vintges@uva.nl",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Findings show that while poor women may be stigmatized as inadequate mothers, middle-class women are pushed to join men in employment and civic sphere at the expense of caring. As both public and private caring supply is underdeveloped and unevenly guaranteed between protected and unprotected workers, women may be constrained to reduce their participation in the labour market.

Against this backdrop, this article asks how, and to what extent, this resurgence of feminist activism has unsettled the centrality of loss within the affective economies of contemporary British feminism, by examining a range of recent texts produced within (pro-feminist) academic, activist, publishing and media spheres. After arguing that attachments to loss remain remarkably intransigent, the latter part of the article draws on Sara Ahmed's account of 'sticky affects' to provide a theoretical account of why notions such as 'young women are not feminist' and 'feminist activism is a thing of the past' continue to yield such force despite empirical evidence to the contrary. © The Author(s) 2012.","Activism; affect; feminism; generations; loss; resurgence; UK",,"Dean, J.; School of Politics and International Studies, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom; email: ipijde@leeds.ac.uk",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Explanations for this behaviour range from naturalistic 'boys will be boys' approaches to analyses which focus on the social construction of masculinity and emphasise the gendered nature of boys' behaviour. Whichever view holds sway, it is often assumed that conflict and disagreement lead, in automatic, linear and unproblematic ways, to instances of physical violence. In fact, the situation is more complicated and less predictable. Provocations (taunts, insults and jostling) may escalate conflict and give rise to fights but this will depend on the form, the social and physical setting, the school's gender regime and, critically, the investment of individual boys in particular constructions of masculinity. In this article, we explore how boys in a coeducational secondary school in Durban, South Africa, verbally provoke one another and how these provocations on some, but not all, occasions result in physical violence. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","conflict; fights; high schools; masculinity; provocation; South Africa; violence",,"Hamlall, V.; School of Education, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Edgewood College Campus, Durban, South Africa; email: vijayhamlall@mweb.co.za",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865071238

In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 participants who left various Sociology departments at different times. It was found that young black female academics dwelled on issues of race in their careers, but paid scant attention to gender. Older white female academics, especially those who had been in senior positions, focused on gender issues, with only brief comments on racial issues. It is argued that racial challenges overshadow gender challenges for black female academics in South Africa and that gender discrimination is only experienced once women reach more senior academic positions. A minority status in academic departments contributes to experiences of racial or gender discrimination, although demographic changes within departments do not necessarily lead to the eradication thereof. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","academic careers; gender; higher education; race; sociology; South Africa",,"Rabe, M.; Department of Sociology, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa; email: rabeme@unisa.ac.za",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865095411

The project involved 14 participants comprising teachers, school learners and pre-service teachers. The study found that queer youth have negative experiences of schooling which range from punitive actions expressed through derogatory language to vicious reactionary hate, often expressed through violence and often perpetrated by teachers. This paper also found resist-stances from queer learners in portraying a positive self-image for themselves as a mechanism for coping with homophobia. As a way of looking forward, it locates teachers at the centre of bringing about change for the queer learners and argues for a re-education of teachers in order to tackle homophobia in schools. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","difference and diversity; heteronormativity; homophobia; narratives; queer theory; sexualities and education",,"Msibi, T.; Faculty of Education, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Private Bag X03, Ashwood, Pinetown, South Africa; email: msibi@ukzn.ac.za",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865067841

There have been numerous studies that have attempted to acquire an understanding of the breadth and depth of the issues around gender-based violence. However, one area that has received scant attention is the voices of women teachers. Thus, in this article, drawing on qualitative research and focus group interviews, we explore the voices of women teachers who teach in a rural school in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, around their views of gender-based violence. We conclude that their voices, both in relation to broader societal issues as well as in the school context, speak about a strong awareness of what is generally regarded as the 'foundation' of gender-based violence, i.e. gender inequality. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","secondary school; sub-Saharan Africa; teachers; violence; women",,"de Lange, N.; Faculty of Education, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; email: naydene.delange@nmmu.ac.za",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865076918

Yet, women still remain, for the most part, a minority within leadership positions in education. Despite policy initiatives emphasising gender equity, discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping continue to perpetuate the myth of women's submissiveness and remain a redoubtable barrier for impeding women in acquiring leadership positions. The awareness of gender politics combined with challenges related to gender equity in organisations remain a thorny concern in education circles. This paper examines the barriers South African women experience. A qualitative approach was employed using a post-colonial feminist perspective.

We argue that Southern theory is not an on-the-shelf solution to global geopolitical inequalities but a work in process that is important both for the global South and to simultaneously dethrone and enrich Northern, mainstream theory. The article begins with a prologue explaining the origins and profile of the particular politics of knowledge production discussed in this issue. In the next section, we consider the notion of the 'global South' and trace the way in which knowledge itself is imprinted with the legacies of imperialism and colonialism, both in the North and in the South, with different agendas for theory arising from the historical positions of each. We then offer a very brief contextualisation of the issue in the specific context of South Africa, drawing on the articles to explore the particular nuances and issues raised by its particular historical and geopolitical location. In so doing, we point to some of the very difficult questions raised by the relationship between indigenous and modernist (Northern) knowledges. We move on to suggest some ways of thinking about intervening to challenge and potentially alleviate inequalities, showing that policy is not enough. In conclusion, we return to Southern theory, noting some of the limitations to which a journal like Gender and Education can contribute and the journey yet to travel while celebrating the fact and nature of this issue as a contribution to the development of Southern theory from and in South Africa. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender; HIV and AIDS; South Africa; Southern theory; violence",,"Epstein, D.; School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University, Wales, United Kingdom; email: epsteind@cf.ac.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865093543

The present article provides an updated analysis of the state of psychological research by examining research published in 2007 in eight prominent journals across four subdisciplines (N = 255). Two types of data were examined: (1) gender and racial-ethnic representation at the levels of editor, senior author, and participant, and (2) the presence of biased assumptions in reporting tendencies. Representation was interpreted in relation to relevant baselines drawn from U. S. data. Women and members of racial-ethnic minority groups do not appear to be underrepresented as editors in mainstream psychology. However, women continue to be underrepresented as senior authors, and members of racial-ethnic minority groups continue to be underrepresented as research participants. Furthermore, studies using predominately male or White samples (vs. female or racial-ethnic minority samples) were less likely to indicate participant gender or race-ethnicity in the title and marginally less likely to provide a rationale for including participants of only one social group, consistent with the notion that reporting tendencies within mainstream psychological research continue to reflect assumptions that men and Whites are more typical members of the category ""human"" than are women and racial-ethnic minorities. These findings indicate that mainstream psychology has not yet reached social equity and that efforts to increase diversity and decrease subtle biases should continue to be supported and funded. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Androcentrism; Ethnicity; Ethnocentrism; Gender; Race",,"Cundiff, J.

The current survey study investigated how 9th grade sports participation relates to perceived gender discrimination from peers and adults at school over four time points spanning 10th through 12th grade. The ethnically diverse sample (46. 6 % Hispanic/Latina/Mexican-American, 14. 1 % Asian-American/Pacific Islander, 12. 8 % African-American/Black, 11. 5 % European-American/White, 15. 1 % Other/Mixed) consisted of 384 girls in the southwestern United States. Results of growth modeling showed that 9th grade athletes (n = 309) perceived greater gender discrimination relative to girls who were not involved in sports (n = 75), and accelerated in peer gender discrimination compared to non-athletes. Athletes and non-athletes did not differ in perceived gender discrimination from adults at school. Analyses conducted separately within each ethnic group revealed that ethnic groups did not differ in patterns of gender discrimination. These findings suggest that girls who play sports may experience differential treatment from their peers.

S. culture, the feminine body has been positioned as an object to be looked at and sexually gazed upon; thus, females often learn to view themselves from an observer's perspective and to treat themselves as objects to be looked at (i. e., self-objectification). Self-objectification often results in negative outcomes, such as body dissatisfaction, among Caucasian samples, but the correlates and consequences of self-objectification among African Americans are less clear. Given that this construct may vary considerably across racial/ethnic groups, the current study considers how self-objectification affects both African American and Caucasian college women's body dissatisfaction. This was assessed via two prospective mediation models that utilized bootstrapping techniques. In the first model, trait anxiety was tested as a mediator of the relation between body surveillance, the behavioral indicator of self-objectification, and body dissatisfaction; in the second model, body surveillance was examined as a mediator of the relation between trait anxiety and body dissatisfaction. Participants at Time 1 were 276 undergraduate women attending a Midwestern university in the U. S.; 97 (35%) described themselves as African American/Black, and 179 as Caucasian non-Hispanic/White; at Time 2, 70 African American females and 156 Caucasian females provided data. At these two time points, separated by about 5 months, participants completed the same set of questionnaires. Results indicated that the first mediation model was not significant for either group, but the second model was significant for the Caucasian women. Results provide some support for the differential effects of self-objectification on women's body dissatisfaction depending on race/ethnicity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Anxiety; Body dissatisfaction; Body surveillance; Race/ethnicity; Self-objectification",,"Bardone-Cone, A.

One-hundred and eighty-four South Australian undergraduate women viewed appearance-focused or neutral music videos, with half in each condition simultaneously participating in a bout of exercise or in quiet rest. Participants completed pre- and post- state measures of mood, body satisfaction and self-objectification. As expected, exposure to appearance-focused music videos produced increased state self-objectification in comparison to neutral images. For body satisfaction, an interaction emerged for the dimension of physical attractiveness, whereby women who exercised and watched appearance-focused video clips felt more attractive than women watching the same clips who did not exercise, and felt no less attractive than women who watched neutral clips. The findings demonstrate that thin-ideal music videos serve to increase state self-objectification, but that exercise can ameliorate the negative effects of idealized media images on women's feelings of physical attractiveness. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body image; Exercise; Media; Self-objectification; Thin ideal",,"Prichard, I.; Public Health, Flinders University, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide 5001, Australia; email: Ivanka.Prichard@flinders.edu.au",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863100600

Measures of self-objectification, objectification of others, social comparison, body shame, body dissatisfaction, and eating disorder symptomatology were completed by 549 female students between the ages of 18 and 30 years from a large university in the southeastern United States. Structural equation modeling with nested model comparisons was used to examine the fit of the new theoretical model relative to less complex models which contain only relationships which have received previous attention in the research literature (e. g., the relationship between self-objectification and body shame). Results indicated that the new theoretical model demonstrates good fit for the data and that the fit of this model is significantly better than the original model suggested by the literature.

The goals of this study were to determine whether feminists endorsed attachment parenting and whether stereotypes of feminists' beliefs corresponded to actual feminists' attitudes. Women were recruited online, primarily through blogs, to complete an online survey about feminism and mothering. Four hundred and thirty one women comprised the sample for the current investigation and included heterosexual-identified feminist mothers (n = 147), feminist non-mothers (n = 75), non-feminist mothers (n = 143), and non-feminist non-mothers (n = 66). Participants were asked to rate their own attitudes towards specific practices associated with attachment parenting and to indicate their perceptions of the beliefs of the typical feminist. Results indicated that feminists were more supportive of attachment parenting practices than were non-feminists. Non-feminists, particularly mothers, held misperceptions about the typical feminist, seeing them as largely uninterested in the time-intensive and hands-on practices associated with attachment parenting. Feminist mothers also held stereotypes about feminists and saw themselves as somewhat atypical feminists who were more interested in attachment parenting than they thought was typical of feminists. Our data indicated that feminists did endorse attachment parenting and that stereotypes of feminists related to attachment parenting are untrue.

One factor that may serve this function is the tendency to hold negative stereotypes about feminists. Indeed, the constructs of ambivalent sexism (Glick and Fiske 1996) and ambivalence toward men (Glick and Fiske 1999) provide a strong theoretical basis for the prediction that traditional attitudes toward women and men are related to the derogation of women who do not conform to the feminine-stereotyped gender role. Therefore, the present study utilized path analysis to test a mediational model in which traditional attitudes toward women and men predict the tendency to stereotype feminists, which in turn predicts feminist identity. The present study also examined whether the relations between the variables in the model differed for African American, European American, and Latina women. Participants consisted of 544 women from the southern United States who, despite being undergraduates, were in their mid-to-late twenties on average. As expected, participant ethnicity moderated the paths in the model. Among African American and Latina women, hostility toward men and hostile sexism predicted the tendency to stereotype feminists, which then predicted feminist identity. Support for the mediational model was not obtained among European American women; instead, the model for European American women was characterized by direct paths from traditional attitudes toward women and men to feminist identity. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering participants' ethnic background when assessing predictors of feminist identity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ethnicity; Feminist identification; Path analysis; Sexism",,"Robnett, R.

One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Anti-transgender prejudice; Attitudes toward; Helping relationships; Trans persons",,"Carroll, L.; Department of Public Health, University of North Florida, 1UNF Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32224-2676, United States; email: lcarroll@unf.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867559190

This article identifies three such tensions, arising respectively in: (i) the inauguration of the democratic public; (ii) enabling equal participation; and (iii) the relationship between instrumental and non-instrumental accounts of democracy's value. In each case, I argue, rather than seeking somehow to dissolve or avoid such tensions, theories of democracy should allow us to live with their implications reflexively: to work with them. Such tensions are counter-democratic to the extent that they derail what Nancy Fraser calls "" participatory parity,"" under which citizens count as "" full partners in social interaction."" But the extent to which they do this is not itself dependent on points of paradox in the very idea of inclusion. Such parity relies on complex factors, social and economic, which democratic institutions and procedures will not by themselves address.

That question lies at the heart of this article. It will be explored through the theoretical frame offered in the work of Giorgio Agamben on the state of exception and the example of British state collusion in non-state violence in the North of Ireland. The North of Ireland provides a particularly illuminating case study to explore how the state of exception-the suspension of law and of legal norms and the exercise of arbitrary decision-has increasingly become a paradigm of contemporary governance. In so doing it brings into question not only the traditional conceptualization of the "" democratic dilemma"" of liberal democratic states "" confronting terrorism"" but also challenge dominant paradigms of transitional justice that generally fail to problematize the liberal democratic order.

Theorizing property as intrinsically political demands a return to Marx but on terms he may not have recognized. I outline a politics of property in this paper contending that there can be no universal justification for any regime of property. Property is by definition the institution of a wrong. The articulation of something as property establishes a border, determining what can be owned, how far ownership extends, where it is limited, as well as terms of use and terms of abuse. It establishes a set of property relations, and defines a vocabulary of the proper. Here sovereign state power is enlisted to enforce relations of property beneficial to some, but not all. A challenge to any political regime must of necessity put in to question both the forms of proper behaviour, and the regime of property. These are intrinsically related to each other. I conclude by arguing that democracy is always improper. Property, in all of its forms entails enclosure. Enclosure requires the drawing and the maintenance of boundaries of exclusion and inclusion. The sovereign determination of the proper, as well as of the exception to the proper defines trespass.

The paper draws on previous research that has established that many aspects of leadership style positively related to leaders' effectiveness are associated with the female gender role. Consistent with this assumption, the authors examined a sample of 157 Spanish managers whether significant sex differences favouring women emerge in relevant leadership dimensions (i.e. individualized consideration, contingent reward and emotional intelligence) and whether gender identity traits may help to explain such differences. Results show that male leaders' lower scores in individualized consideration, positive contingent reward and emotional intelligence are partly explained by their lower identification with expressive traits. Furthermore, results indicate that integration of counterstereotypical traits into the self positively relates to effectiveness in the sense of use of a wider range of leadership styles for both women and men. Future research could explore in more detail how sex differences in leadership styles are associated with gendered traits of identity in different countries, as well as whether a blend of masculine and feminine traits is predictive for a more multifaceted leadership style. The findings are discussed in terms of how a gender perspective may help to better understand leadership effectiveness in contemporary organizations, especially in the case of male leaders. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Androgyny; Gender; Identity; Leadership; Spain",,,,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986052383

Because disclosure was not associated with condom use and condom use was low, it is important to continue efforts to promote consistent condom use, especially among females, regardless of the reported sexual orientation of their partners. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","condom use; disclosure; Men who have sex with men and women",,"Sullivan, P.

In 2007, a household survey of 919 women was conducted in Tete province, Mozambique, as part of the World Health Organization Multicountry Study on Gender, Sexuality, and Vaginal Practices. Women aged 18 to 60 years old were interviewed to determine prevalence and motivations for vaginal practices. A large range of frequently used practices was identified. Nearly 80% of women reported three or more current practices, and virtually all had used at least three practices in their lifetime. Elongation of the vaginal labia minora was universal (99% of women), while a quarter stated they had made small vaginal cuts or incisions at least once. Ninety-two percent of women also reported ever use of intravaginal cleansing, and insertion of substances in the vagina was practiced by 72%. Around half (48%) reported ingestion of substances to affect the vagina, mostly to heat, tighten, or loosen the vagina. Application of substances on the genitalia (16%) and steaming (15%) were less popular. To prepare for sexual intercourse, women reported products were commonly applied, ingested, inserted, or steamed. Pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum were also associated with ingestion (26%), steaming (39%), and cutting (32%). Adoption of microbicides and condom use may be influenced by vaginal practices. HIV-prevention messages and interventions, including future microbicides, need to take into account the high prevalence of vaginal practices and motivations for their use. Further attention needs to be given to potentially harmful practices in HIV-prevention efforts in Mozambique. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","douching; gender; household survey; Mozambique; Vaginal practices",,"Bagnol, B.; Anthropology, University of the Witwatersrand, Postnet Suite 42, Private Bag X9, Melville 2092, Johannesburg, South Africa; email: bagnolbrigitte@gmail.com",,,19317611,,,,"English","Int.

The most frequent reasons for joining the industry included money, sex, and attention. Only one participant indicated that she was coerced into becoming a porn actress. The most favorable aspects of their work included money, people, sex, and freedom/independence, whereas the most frequently reported dislikes included people, sexually transmitted diseases, and exploitation.

Less attention is paid to the consequences of being excluded from this specific type of care-what we could call the right to parent. Gay and lesbian parents claiming their right to parent represents a momentous historical change: the increasing visibility of these parents is one of the most important components of such change.Emotional dynamics are key to this social change. Emotions constitute the link between doing parenting at the micro level of interactions and doing, or undoing, difference at the macro level of social structures; similarly, different ways to do parenting and to do gender must be taken into account if we want to grasp a truly comprehensive picture of the phenomenon of parenthood. This article draws on a wider study on different kinds of care and caregivers, whose aim is to offer a more inclusive interpretation and a more reliable discourse on family care and parenthood. Parenthood is still societally significant, but different ways to attain parenthood (biologically, through adoption, surrogacy, etc.) or to be a parent (single or in a couple, gay or heterosexual, married or unmarried, etc.) seem to mark a more important difference. While such difference can translate into inequality, this is now being challenged by these increasingly more visible parents. Our findings show that the divide between the categories of ""parents"" and ""non-parents"" dissolves the divide between the categories of ""gay/lesbian"" and ""non-gay/lesbian."" Gay and lesbian parents produce social change by taking the sexuality out of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered (GLBT) politics in the mainstream arena. Same-sex parenthood may still be perceived by many as a ""scandal,"" but more and more as a respectable one. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","emotions; gay and lesbian parenthood; inequality; social change",,"Pratesi, A.; Department of Social Studies and Counselling, University of Chester, Chester, Cheshire CH1 4BJ, United Kingdom; email: a.pratesi@chester.ac.uk",,,1550428X,,,,"English","J.

Casual-calculated disclosure is identified as a method for social control, when disclosing information about the family structure becomes inevitable for an individual.

This qualitative, grounded theory analysis of 21 transcripts of couple therapy sessions examined how therapist actions influenced the balance of power between partners in the moment to moment processes of therapy. The analysis identified five kinds of therapist actions that perpetuated power imbalances: (a) discounting the person in the one-down position, (b) allowing the one-up person to define the conversation, (c) reinforcing dominant person's negative comments about partner, (d) using professional privilege to assume experience of the one-down person, and (e) speaking as though the relationship was equal when it was not. Six other actions helped interrupt current power imbalances and encouraged more equal power: (a) using therapist voice to create balance, (b) creating space for one-down voice, (c) naming power discrepancies, (d) validating competence of the one-down person, (e) suggesting new options, and (f) encouraging powerful partner to shift to a relational perspective. The results help couple therapists develop greater sensitivity and awareness of the impact of their interventions on the power balance of the couple. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","couple therapy; gender interventions; inequality; power",,"Knudson-Martin, C.; Department of Counseling and Family Sciences, Loma Linda University, Griggs Hall, Loma Linda, CA 92352, United States; email: cknudsonmartin@illu.edu",,,15332691,,,,"English","J.

There is limited evidence that traditional proxies for bargaining power, such as relative earnings level, affect outcomes.

The results suggest that zero-rating a well-targeted selection of basic foodstuffs and fuel for household use is important in protecting female-type households, especially those in the lowest quintiles and with children, from bearing an otherwise disproportionate share of the tax burden. In contrast, high taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and fuel for private transport result in a larger incidence on male-type households.

All members of the community suffer as a result of recurrent droughts, but the effects are often more severe on vulnerable groups such as children, elderly people, and some women. This paper uses the experiences of the relief organisation Kujenga Maisha East Africa (KUMEA) to understand the importance of looking beyond gender in humanitarian interventions. Here we focus on the importance of understanding the socio-economic and political context surrounding the drought and the associated humanitarian interventions, using a feminist lens to assess power relations. This includes looking into the aspects of vulnerability and resourcefulness in the context of food security, food distribution, nutrition, and livelihood assistance.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on previous research that has established that many aspects of leadership style positively related to leaders' effectiveness are associated with the female gender role. Consistent with this assumption, the authors examined a sample of 157 Spanish managers whether significant sex differences favouring women emerge in relevant leadership dimensions (i.e. individualized consideration, contingent reward and emotional intelligence) and whether gender identity traits may help to explain such differences. Findings: Results show that male leaders' lower scores in individualized consideration, positive contingent reward and emotional intelligence are partly explained by their lower identification with expressive traits. Furthermore, results indicate that integration of counter-stereotypical traits into the self positively relates to effectiveness in the sense of use of a wider range of leadership styles for both women and men. Research limitations/implications: Future research could explore in more detail how sex differences in leadership styles are associated with gendered traits of identity in different countries, as well as whether a blend of masculine and feminine traits is predictive for a more multifaceted leadership style.

While the effect of motherhood, working hours, career breaks and school aged children upon career progression has been discussed widely, its actual scale and magnitude has received less research attention. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of these factors individually and cumulatively. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers the impact of the above through a longitudinal analysis of a demographically unique national database, comprising the 46,565 registered nursing workforces in NHS Scotland from 2000-2008. The variables examined include gender, employment grades, number and length of career breaks, lengths of service, age, working patterns, the number and age of dependent children. Findings: The results indicate: motherhood has a regressively detrimental effect on women's career progression. However, this is a simplistic term which covers a more complex process related to the age of dependent children, working hours and career breaks. The degree of women's restricted career progression is directly related to the school age of the dependent children: the younger the child the greater the detrimental impact. Women who take a career break of greater than two years see their careers depressed and restricted. The results confirm that whilst gender has a relatively positive effect on male career progression; a women's career progression is reduced incrementally as she has more children, and part-time workers have reduced career progression regardless of maternal or paternal circumstances. Originality/value: This paper is the only example internationally, of a national workforce being examined on this scale and therefore its findings are significant. For the first time the impact of motherhood upon a women's career progression and the related factors - dependent children, career breaks and part-time working are quantified. These findings are relevant across many areas of employment and they are significant in relation to broadening the debate around equal opportunities for women. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Career breaks; Career progression; Dependent children; Employment; Gender; Motherhood; Nursing; United Kingdom; Working hours",,"McIntosh, B.; Business and Economics, Richmond University, London, United Kingdom; email: bryan.mcintosh@richmond.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863801620

Perspectives and empirical work that embrace the contextual nature of masculine expression have been especially underrepresented (O'Neil, 2008a). However, the term context has perhaps been defined too narrowly thus far to refer only to the factors that may moderate or mediate the impact of gender role conflict on various outcomes for men. In this exploratory study, we examined, through quantitative and experimental methods, a broader notion of contextuality that focuses on how situations impact the report of gender role conflict itself. Consistent with hypotheses, we found that an experimental manipulation prior to administration of the Gender Role Conflict Scale (O'Neil, Helms, Gable, David, & Wrightsman, 1986) significantly altered participants' scores on this widely used and validated measure. These effects obtained regardless of whether men scored high or low on a measure of self-concept clarity, suggesting that the result is not an artifact produced only by men unclear about their overall identity.

Using data from an in-depth investigation of the perspective and practice of a single teacher, I discuss some of the dilemmas faced by this expert science practitioner as she tries to find the most successful ways for facilitating children's learning. The dilemmas I discuss here describe tensions around how scientific knowledge should be presented to children, how children learn science and modes of pedagogy. I show that while some of these dilemmas arise from a conflict between the teacher's own ideals and the external requirements placed upon her, others reflect important tensions within her own values and commitments. I argue that a language of dilemmas allows us to understand pedagogic practice as dynamic in character, as frequently involving difficult choices, in which ideals are traded off against one another. This dilemmatic perspective contrasts sharply both with those views of primary science teaching that treat it as the authoritative transmission of basic skills or facts and those that treat it as the acting out of a coherent ideology. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","ethnography; primary science expertise; resolution of dilemmas; sociocultural perspectives",,"Traianou, A.; Department of Educational Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London, New Cross, London, SE14 6NW, United Kingdom; email: a.traianou@gold.ac.uk",,,17457823,,,,"English","Ethnogr.

Nowadays, however, the traditional topic of learning in out-of-school contexts recovers its relevance because the development of technologies, globalisation and inequality create new contexts for knowledge. Peasant and indigenous children's productive activities in countryside are frequently defined as children's labour, tending to emphasise the obstacles to attending school and ignoring the production of knowledge about natural world.

Therefore, in this work we take a social justice perspective to look at the relationship between environmental science education, dominant environmental narratives and how places and youth are constructed and positioned through environmental education. To this end, we examine how borders - and their corresponding margins - construct place in environmental education and to discuss implications of this construction of place for issues of environmental justice and equity. Borders both demarcate categories and serve to reify existing social and political relationships. Therefore, we ask the following questions: (1) What is the role of borders in constructing place in environmental education? (2) How do youth position themselves with respect to these borders? and (3) What are implications for the design of environmental education learning environments that work towards goals of social and environmental justice? We found that prevailing environmental education narratives construct borders using what we call discourses of fear and privilege, and that these boundaries position communities and youth in ways that reify existing social and political power relationships. We also found that youth resist these constructions both through counter-script and performance of identity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","borders; environmental education; equity; identity; place; social justice",,"Tzou, C.

School curriculum reform, for example by Scottish Government, promotes 'science for citizenship', yet teachers' understandings of the nature of science and its relationship with society are often underdeveloped. This article reports on the experiences of a group of first-year students enrolled in the course 'socio-cultural perspectives in science learning' within a primary teacher education programme. Drawing on sociocultural theory, attention was given to language as a system for constructing symbolic realities. Through participation in activities, which explored science knowledge production and communication, students were encouraged to reflect on the nature of science and the dynamic relationship between content, methods and value-frameworks. Findings cluster around interconnected themes: students' views of knowledge, language genres across communities and knowledge-power negotiations. The course attempted to move from a space for knowledge consumption to an intermediary space between science and society for students to inhabit in the dual roles of citizens and co-constructors of knowledge. In this transition, linguistic genres pointed to the complexity of interactions between curricular materials offered by the course and newly established social networks.

In taking creative license and entering Yentl's world, a new voice and narrative emerges for her and the major characters in the story. Using psychoanalytic relational theories on multiple self-states and postmodern gender and sexuality perspectives, this article undertakes fleshing out the characters and the motives of Bashevis Singer in writing the story. From each character's point of view we learn more of Yentl's subjectivity, her multiply oriented desires from multiple self-states, and expand Singer's story from its original linear course. In Singer's work, Yentl is a two dimensional girl possessing the soul of a man, which would mean in the 19th-century Poland Jewish shtetl world that she longs to study Torah/Talmud in a yeshiva. From this paradoxical premise the story eventually ends with Yentl surrendering all claim to the male world of study and then vanishing from the story altogether.

The article demonstrates that these novels both 'do' and 'undo' gender and business ownership. They portray women who are successful business while displaying culturally accepted norms of femininity but who are set apart from other female characters. However, their partial and conflictual identification with norms of gender and entrepreneurship could lead a reader to question those norms and through the undoing of the protagonists, the novels offer alternative performances and performativities of doing gender and of doing business. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Butler; Contemporary fiction; Gender; Performativity; Small business; Women entrepreneurs","entrepreneur; firm ownership; gender identity; womens status","Phillips, M.; Department of Management, University of Bristol, 8 Woodland Road, Bristol BS8 1TN, United Kingdom; email: Mary.Phillips@bristol.ac.uk",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862687430

The results indicate that many gay and bisexual men live in stressful environments which may contribute to negative health and mental health outcomes among them. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual men; coping; gay men; victimization; violence",,"Martin, J.

However, assessing a community's readiness in response to the issue of IPV in LGBT communities locates the issue where outcry is most likely to occur. Utilizing the Community Readiness Model in lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities in two rural and two urban communities, this study revealed a low level of community readiness to address IPV. Only vague awareness of IPV exists in these sexual orientation, gender identity, and geographic communities. The study suggests specific next steps tailored to raise LGBT communities' readiness to address IPV from within their own communities, starting at the current low level. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","community readiness; intimate partner violence; LGBT; prevention",,"Turell, S.; Clarion University, Academic Affairs, 840 Wood Street, Clarion, PA 16214, United States; email: sturell@clarion.edu",,,10538720,,,,"English","J.

While the early-life economic disadvantages of motherhood are well established, little work has examined whether these disadvantages persist into later life. Life course research consistently demonstrates the relationship between early-life choices and later-life inequality, but few studies have examined whether the reproductive phase of a woman's life is associated with her later-life income. Using data from the 2003 wave of the National Longitudinal Survey of Mature Women cohort, this research examines whether women's age at first birth and parity are associated with her later-life income within the context of marriage. From a set of multivariate analyses, I find that despite a marginal statistically significant effect, substantively for the women in this cohort the effects of childbearing are not particularly consequential for later-life income. The results suggest that as women age the economic penalties associated with motherhood are less important to financial well-being than are other factors. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","aging; income; motherhood","aged; article; economics; employment; female; human; income; maternal age; parity; statistics; United States; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Employment; Female; Humans; Income; Maternal Age; Parity; United States","Jokinen-Gordon, H.; Department of Sociology, Florida State University, 526 Bellamy Bldg, Tallahassee, FL 32306, United States; email: hmj09e@fsu.edu",,,08952841,,,22757761,"English","J.

For the explanation of this paradox, it seeks to address the unwanted effects of Francoist education policy, especially the effects of social elitism and single-sex education on the presence of girls. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","fascism; Francoism; secondary education; Spain; women",,"Canales, A.

On one hand, they are urged to maintain or even increase their engagement, to translate their experience and seniority into leadership roles finally available to women after many years of struggle. On the other hand, they are reminded that they have earned the right to retire and rest, and are bombarded with messages reminding them to be concerned about the encroaching limitations and problems associated with aging. These competing prescriptions are most evident in the realms of work/career and physical health/activity, where either early disengagement or refusal to disengage can cause problems. Women who exit early from employment may face poverty and deprive society of important contributions; those who resist retirement may face stress, exhaustion, and missed opportunities for fulfillment in other domains. Women who stop physical activity as they age face a variety of health consequences; those who persist run the risk of injury. Thus, women's negotiation of these contradictory prescriptions requires a complex balancing act. Therapists can assist older women in finding the right balance by acknowledging their own biases, helping women both to acknowledge their internalization of ageist stereotypes and to recognize ways in which ageing may increase their empowerment by releasing them from certain constraints. They can encourage their clients to maintain and increase their power through physical activity and support women's resistance to debilitating messages by exposing them to a wide range of older women as role models. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","aging; employment; fitness; mental health; physical health; retirement; women",,"Lips, H.

To assess expressive and instrumental personality traits, participants completed the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ; Spence and Helmreich 1978). Participants also rated their endorsement of communal and agentic goals and strategies for managing hypothetical conflicts presented in the ""Peer Conflict Management Questionnaire."" This questionnaire, created for the purposes of this study, consisted of 4 vignettes that portrayed hypothetical conflicts with a friend and a romantic partner. Results showed that women were more likely than men to endorse communal strategies when managing conflict with a same-gender friend, but not with a romantic partner. Women were more likely than men to endorse agentic strategies for managing conflict with a romantic partner, but not with a same-gender friend. For conflicts with a same-gender friend, communal goals, but not expressive traits or gender, predicted communal strategy endorsement. For conflicts with a romantic partner, gender and agentic goals predicted agentic strategies; instrumental traits did not.

Consequently, working in this type of environment may stimulate the father's involvement in childcare. For the case of Spain, based on the sample of 3,094 males originating in the macro Survey of Quality of Life in the Workplace of 2007, an indicator of a family-friendly company was constructed. From this indicator, as well as other socio-labor variables that appear in the survey, a descriptive statistical analysis and a multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried in order to know, first, if working in this type of workplace exerts a positive effect on male workers' willingness to take maternity leave (in the event of having a child); and, second, what is the effect on this willingness of some other relevant socio-labor variables (age, university studies, non-working partner, working in public administration and high net monthly earnings). Findings indicated that age, having a non-working partner and being high income men are factors reducing male workers' inclination to ask for leave. And, conversely, working in family-friendly companies makes it more likely that males will take leave. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Childbirth leave; Family-friendly company; Father involvement in childcare; Female bias in reconciliation; Reconciliation of work and family life",,"Fernández-Cornejo, J.

Questionnaire and phone diary data were collected from mothers, fathers, and youths from 236 Mexican American families living in the southwestern US. Preliminary cluster analysis identified three patterns: Traditional divisions of labor and traditional attitudes, egalitarian divisions of labor and egalitarian attitudes, and an incongruent pattern, with a traditional division of labor but egalitarian attitudes. MANOVAs, and follow-up, mixed- and between-group ANOVAs, revealed that these groups of families differed in parents' time constraints, socioeconomic resources, and cultural orientations. Mothers in the congruent egalitarian group worked more hours and earned higher incomes as compared to mothers in the congruent traditional and incongruent groups, and the emergence of the incongruent group was grounded in within-family, interparental differences in work hours and incomes. Parents' patterns of gendered practices and beliefs were linked to their youths' housework participation, time with mothers versus fathers, and gender role attitudes. Youths in the congruent traditional group reported more traditional gender role attitudes than did youths in the congruent egalitarian and incongruent groups, and gender atypical housework participation and time with parents were only observed in the congruent egalitarian group. Findings demonstrate the utility of a within-family design to understand complex gendered phenomena, and highlight the multidimensional nature of gender and the importance of contextualizing the study of ethnic minorities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender role attitudes; Gender socialization; Household labor; Mexican American families; Pattern analytic approach",,"Lam, C.

Men were less forgiving in terms of revenge-seeking behaviour, but men and women did not differ in avoidance of transgressors. The relationships between empathic concern and both facets of forgiveness were similar for men and women, as was the relationship between empathic concern and avoidance. However, the relationship between perspective-taking and avoidance was stronger among men than women. We found little support for the prediction that in this collectivist cultural context, perspective-taking would play a greater role than empathic concern in forgiveness. Further research is recommended to explore empathy and forgiveness in non-Western populations, with a need to take into account cultural factors. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Empathy; Forgiveness; Gender; Malaysia",,"Mellor, D.; School of Psychology, Deakin University, Burwood 3125, Australia; email: mellor@deakin.edu.au",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861946301

We hypothesized that self-affirmation through their nursing identity would deflect the negative impact of the stereotype threat on performance and would reduce the threat's harmful impact on attentional processes, as reflected in perceived stress, perceived concentration and self-estimate of performance. Ninety-five female students enrolled in a nursing school in France carried out a dosage calculation-a typical nursing task-which drew directly on their math skills. They were assigned to one of four experimental conditions: 2 (threat: task presented as being diagnostic of women's difficulty in math calculation compared to men vs. no threat: task presented as a typical nursing-school exercise) x 2 (self-affirmation: choosing from a list and describing the most important characteristics for them as women and as nurses vs. control condition: same task but for the characteristics that were least important for them but important for other people). As expected, under stereotype threat relating to their math skills, women performed better under the self-affirmation condition than under the control condition. However, this improved performance was associated with a lower self-estimate of their performance.

Comments in the media regarding the lack of women in senior management positions in the creative industries have attracted much attention, both for and against. Despite opposing viewpoints there is little doubt that this is an issue that requires investigation. However, understanding the under-representation of women in senior management, leadership and ownership roles has been problematic due to a lack of “hard data”. The purpose of this paper is to provide a quantitative understanding of the under-representation of female leaders in the UK's creative and cultural industries. Based on a study completed by TBR for the Cultural Leadership Programme (CLP) it presents baseline data and groundbreaking analysis to understand gendered leadership in organisations. The study for CLP established a quantitative evidence base to benchmark the number of women in leadership in the creative and cultural industries. This was possible by utilising a unique data resource, TCR, which enabled detailed analysis of gendered management structures in creative and cultural organisations. We use this evidence base to further understand gender diversity in organisational leadership positions and the characteristics of different leadership styles. The study generated unique understanding regarding gendered leadership within the creative and cultural industries. It identified that there are 32,800 female and 82,450 male leaders in the creative and cultural industries and despite there being a comparatively high proportion of all-female managed organisations, there are half the number of female executives per organisation compared to the UK average. A trend of polarisation of all female and all male led organisations was identified over the last 25 years, which was reflected in recognition of distinct female and male leadership styles. The study proves some assumptions about the leadership approach of men and women and identifies characteristics similar to the transactional and transformational styles described in Women at the Top by Holden and McCarthy. Unless this trend is reversed, it is likely to become increasingly important for women and men to develop skills in both transactional and transformational leadership styles. The paper provides a new examination of the balance of male and female leadership in organisations and significantly furthers debate about the under-representation of women in leadership. It provides “hard-data” to inform future dialogue regarding entrepreneurial women and further investigates the lack of women in leadership. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Creative industries; Gender; Gender theory; Leadership; Transactional leadership; Transformational leadership; United Kingdom; Women",,"Dodd, F.; Trends Business Research Ltd, Newcastle upon TyneUnited Kingdom",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

Focussing primarily on Tuckman's model of group development, male, female and mixed gender learning networks (groups) of entrepreneurs were observed over a six month period, with the observations recorded and analysed, to establish whether different gender networks of business people adhere to Tuckman's model of group development in terms of early development and cohesion through the forming, storming and norming stages. A total of 100 entrepreneurs were recruited in Autumn 2009/Spring 2010 and allocated to three different gender networks, male, female and mixed, in Ireland and Wales (six networks in total), as part of the Sustainable Learning Networks Ireland Wales (SLNIW, for detailed information about SLNIW see www.slniw.com) INTERREG 4A funded project. The groups began networking in January 2010, observed by impartial observers who noted group behaviour and dynamics and recorded observations quantitatively (based on adapted Bales criteria) and qualitatively. It is the results of these observations that form the basis of this paper. This paper analyses the results of the group dynamic witnessed over subsequent network meetings for different gender mixes in Ireland. Whilst the observations are still ongoing, early results indicate that early engagement with group members, team bonding and group dynamics are formed sooner in the single gender groups. The paper explores why this could be the case and considers factors that could then address problems with early group development in mixed gender networks, so that the ultimate “performing” stage of group development and optimal business performance is achieved as early as possible. This paper will be of considerable value to academics, theorists and practitioners.

Achieving growth is central to how a business is run and should be viewed from a business-owner perspective rather than a scholarly perspective, whereby the concept of growth is portrayed so frequently in a fragmented manner. Moreover, academic research on entrepreneurial firm growth has centred on growth from a non-gender specific perspective. The purpose of this paper is to investigate, in a meaningful, practical and relevant manner, the process of growth (i.e. defining growth, growth intention, objectives, planning, and strategy) and the measurement of growth in female-owned businesses. A quantitative research method has been adopted, i.e. an online survey, to investigate all critical issues pertaining to growth amongst female entrepreneurs operating a business for more than five years. Based on the findings of the study, results indicate the process of growth in female-owned businesses differs from that which is frequently reported. Differences exist between characteristics of female entrepreneurs, which in turn impacts not only how they run their business but more importantly how they pursue growth. Furthermore, research demonstrates significant differences in female-owned businesses with regard to all facets that encompass growth – definition, intention, objectives, planning, strategies employed and the measurement of growth applied. The paper seeks to fill the gap of limited information pertaining to the profile of growth-oriented female entrepreneurs from a practical approach. The findings and suggestions for further research will serve to progress research still in its infancy, not only in Ireland but on an international scale, thus being of critical importance to academia, government support agencies, practitioners, policy makers and female entrepreneurs alike in developing relevant and practical supports to assist in promoting growth-oriented businesses. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Business development; Entrepreneurialism; Female entrepreneurs; Ireland; Small firms; Women",,"Costin, Y.; Department of Management and Marketing, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

This is a theoretical paper. The authors argue that individuals can perform exaggerated expressions of femininity (or masculinity) while simultaneously performing alternative expressions of femininity or masculinity. The authors question claims that gender can be undone and incorporate sex category into their understanding of doing gender – it cannot be ignored in experiences of doing gender. The authors contend that the binary divide constrains and restricts how men and women do gender but it can be disrupted or unsettled.

The article examines the manner that the African Union is socioculturally sculpting and re-inventing the universality of the African identity and Pan African Nation. In it, we demonstrate how the African Union (AU) is re-appropriating the idea of Pan Africanism among African and African descendent peoples around the world, and using it creatively to mobilize a reconstruction of a global ""African World View"". This, perspective represents the more nuanced, subtle, invisible-though ideational-bases through which the AU exerts its political power and will to reverse its marginalized circumstance and engage geopolitically in a self-determined posture. Here, we see the role that culture plays in the AU's global governance objectives. We argue that AU cultural globalization rather than ""essentialist"", ""purist"", or ""racialist"" (Gilroy 1993, Appiah 1992) is in effect pluralist, hybrid, transformationalist, and premised on the sustained memory of a global, trans-generational shared set of experiences that have been drawn from as well as reformulated around the idea of Pan Africanism; but that its prospects for fostering political union and assigning citizenship rights to African and African descendent peoples is still an illusion. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","African Union; Culture; Globalization; Identity; International organizations; Pan Africanism",,"Edozie, R.

Regardless of how the dying is accomplished, those who are mourners bear a significant burden of the loss, contingent on several variables, but especially the level of attachment to the deceased. This loss is accommodated or exacerbated depending on culture, social location, and degree of importance accorded to the bereavement. In the case of Diasporic Nigerians all over the world, the bereavement process is a long and arduous one due to their social location outside of their cultural home. Using bereavement theory, this phenomenological and ethnographic study attempts to elicit an understanding of how Nigerians in the Diaspora experience bereavement loss when it happens in the Diaspora but especially in their far away homeland. The study found that Diasporic Nigerians experience bereavement loss differently from those of their host countries. Poignantly, such bereavement loss produce significant stressors than those from mainstream host countries, contingent on social location, absence of culturally relevant mourning rituals, distance to cultural homeland, consanguinal ties, cultural expectations, and financial burden for completing rituals and rites of passages. The study has cultural competency implications and applications for exploring nonlinear ways of revisiting and understanding Diasporic bereavement loss, and the deployment of culturally sensitive and relevant social work practices and interventions with such minority populations. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Bereavement loss; Diasporic status; Lived experience; Mourning rituals and rites; Social and cultural location and alienation",,"Ogbuagu, B.

Moreover, this article discusses how the legal system in the past instructed juries to take race into account in deciding interracial cases. Then, it presents the current legal standard to decide race discrimination cases and how a White federal judge, who is a law school graduate of the White university being sued, ignored the standard and all the African American's evidence to produce a favorable outcome for the White university. Moreover, a White federal magistrate, who also got her law degree from the White university and teaches at the law school part time, assisted the federal judge by not ruling on a key motion to access the dean's computers, permitting the federal judge to rule this computer issue moot.

An understudied population of black men has a long tradition in the black community as conventional adult male role models, mentors, and social fathers for black male youth. Black male coaches have played a significant role in reducing crime and delinquency among at-risk youth as well as influencing positive youth outcomes. Yet this population of African-American men in disadvantaged communities has received little attention.

We find that Perry's images largely reflect E.

We also argue that he is creating new controlling images like the ""Emasculated Black Gentleman."" In these ways, Perry's images may have detrimental consequences including perpetuating Black stereotypes, reinforcing existing class and gender tensions in Black America, and impeding the life chances of middle-class Blacks by suggesting that they are unsuitable for assimilation and integration. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","African Americans; Black bourgeoisie; Black middle-class; Controlling images; Tyler Perry",,"Harris, C.

This latter topic became particularly salient in the British House of Commons following the 2010 general election, when recently adopted reforms introduced intracameral elections for select committee members and chairs. This article outlines three hypotheses concerning the influence of candidate sex on election outcomes: a gender bias against female candidates, a gender advantage favoring female candidates, and gender-neutral outcomes. Drawing on two original data sets, the results not only fail to support the gender-bias hypothesis but also demonstrate that women were advantaged in the interparty elections for committee chairs. These findings offer new insights into both the position of female legislators in the UK Parliament and gender and the allocation of power within national assemblies more generally. © Copyright The Women and Politics Research Section of the American Political Science Association 2012.",,,"O'Brien, D.Z.; Department of Political Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; email: dzobrien@usc.edu",,,1743923X,,,,"English","Polit.

US law and social policy have converged most fully on this issue in a movement to eradicate what has come to be known as the commercial sexual exploitation of children. One outcome of this movement has been an expanded focus on prosecuting and imprisoning pimps and other legal adults who support or abet juridical minors involved in the sex trade. This paper will show that the simplistic, one-size-fitsall narrative of the child victim and the adult exploiter inherent in this policy does not reflect the realities of streetbased sex work in the USA. After 2 years of ethnographic and social network research in two cities, we find that sex market-involved young people participate in a great diversity of market-facilitation relationships, many of which provide the only or the most crucial foundation for their support networks. A social policy based on a onedimensional construction of the child victim and the adult exploiter not only endangers these crucial relationships but also disappears the real needs of young people involved in the exchange of sex for money. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Adolescent; Child; Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC); Pimps; Prostitution; Sex trafficking; Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA); Victim",,"Marcus, A.; John Jay College, City University of New York, 899 Tenth Avenue, New York, NY 10019, United States; email: amarcus@jjay.cuny.edu",,,18689884,,,,"English","Sex.

This article extends our understanding of the role of policy in the coming out process by asking: Under what conditions do policy protections enable gay and lesbian employees to come out? Through a qualitative analysis of the experiences of a particularly vulnerable category of gay and lesbian workers-that of teachers and primary/secondary education professionals-this article provides insight into the on-theground realities that such employees contend with when making decisions about coming out at work. Specifically, this article compares teachers in California, a gay-friendly policy context, with teachers in Texas, a gay-hostile policy context, to ascertain when and how policy protections matter for teachers considering coming out. The findings indicate that policy does matter, but it interacts with school cultures in ways that complicate the decision-making process.

This has manifested itself in the low female participation in the labor force and other structural inequalities between women and men within Turkish society.

Parental leaves and public childcare are associated with higher earnings for mothers when cultural support for maternal employment is high, but have less positive or even negative relationships with earnings where cultural attitudes support the male breadwinner/female caregiver model. © 2012 The Author.

Comprehensive gang reduction models necessitate the inclusion of intervention strategies designed to remove gang members and gang-prone youth and adults from current or potential gang membership. The growth of gangs and gang membership in North Carolina and the renewedfocus on gangs have begged a comprehensive approach to reducing gangs within the state; however, the success of intervention strategies depend upon the support of Taw enforcement officers. The research entailed a survey of 204 gang investigators from across the state at a statewide conference. The results revealed that perceived gang presence and length of work with gang-prone populations were significantly correlated with intervention propensity. Length of work was also significantly related when controlling for confounding variables. Future directions and recommendations are also discussed.",,,"Lafond, B.; N.C.

However, empirical data on gang membership suggests that social work interventions may prove more effective in addressing gangs than law enforcement strategies. Using data from a comprehensive gang assessment of middle school and high school gang members in two rural locations in North Carolina, this study identified three social work-related dimensions of gang membership: family awareness, membership dynamics and membership stability. The study isolated and analyzed nine gang-related variables. The study found that the largest proportions of gang members joined the gang as a result of high-ordered needs such as the need for belonging and excitement. Additional finding suggest that the majority of gang members had parents who were unaware that their child was involved in gang-related activity at the time the child joined the gang. The data also suggest that a large majority of gang members would never consider leaving the gang. When examining the data on parental awareness, membership motives and the respondents ' attitudes toward gang desistance, the findings support the re-conceptualization of gangs as a social work phenomenon.

This is particularly important for questions of gender relationships, as the majority of microcredit recipients worldwide are low-income women. However, most assessments of microcredit and gender emphasize issues of individual empowerment rather than the large-scale political implications of credit provision. In this article, I critique the use of mainstream empowerment models employed in the assessment of microcredit's ability to provoke changes in gender relationships. I argue that these models often fail to describe microcredit's effects on women's lives due to their epistemological framework, which pushes aside questions of geographical and historical specificity in pursuit of a universally empowered microcredit subject.

While the experience of displacement among Taira and other so-called 'war brides' cannot be understood without a consideration of socio-historical and economic constraints that characterized their emigration, my aim here is not to analyse how Taira's senryu simply reflects her diasporic victimhood but to explore how she exercises her creative agency to make her new home familiar and habitable by engaging with the everyday poetry practice of alternation between 'pause' and 'move' in the midst of changing landscapes.

In particular, this article finds that Ottawa, as both a historic center of antigay activity and a more recent center of an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered) rights-seeking agenda in Canada, encourages practices that are based on discretion, gender normalization, and maintenance of the status quo. The article argues that these practices - with some notable exceptions - have led to a fragmented gay community characterized by economic and professional stratification, out-of-town consumption of gay culture, and a lack of recognizable social, political, and geographic focal points for gay men.

Yet, many programmes focus on the economic benefit to women without necessarily looking at the impact on gender relations at the household level and its implications on women. Using quantitative and qualitative data from the Dangme West district of Ghana, this article shows how poverty reduction programmes with credit components can reduce women's vulnerability to poverty and empower them. But much more needs to be done to complement these efforts. The study shows that women beneficiaries as against women non-beneficiaries have significantly improved their socio-economic status through access to financial and non-financial resources. This has in certain instances improved gender relations at the household level, with women being recognized as earners of income and contributors to household budget. However, some women still regard their spouses as 'heads' and require their consent in decisions even in issues that have to do with their own personal lives. Moreover, the improved economic status of women has resulted in a 'power conflict', creating confrontation between spouses. The article recommends that, as part of their programmes, assisting organizations and institutions must address 'power relations', the basis of gender subordination at the household level, otherwise socio-cultural norms and practices, underpinned by patriarchal structures, will remain 'cages' for rural women. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Dangme West; empowerment; gender; Ghana; poverty","accessibility; credit provision; empowerment; gender relations; poverty; quantitative analysis; socioeconomic status; womens employment; womens status; Dangme West; Ghana; Greater Accra","Wrigley-Asante, C.; Department of Geography and Resource Development, University of Ghana, PO Box LG 59, Legon, Ghana; email: cwrigley27@hotmail.com",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861943750

Design/methodology/approach: The research drew on in-depth interviews with a sample of 18 female alumni from three British business schools. Data were analyzed using NVivo 8.0. within the career-competencies framework of Knowing-how, Knowing-why and Knowing-whom. Findings: Women aged between 30 and 34 years emphasized the importance of gaining confidence (Knowing-why) and skills (Knowing-how) while those aged between 35 and 45 years focused on developing networks (Knowing-whom). This study suggests that age and career stage may have considerable impact on perceptions of acquired career competencies. Research limitations/implications: This is an exploratory piece with limited generalisability; however, it exposes the need to clarify the concept of career stage for women. Practical implications: Business schools have historically stressed the career benefits of MBA programmes in terms of improved capital and of changing career directions. This research indicates that an EMBA may offer a more level playing field for women with respect to networking activities. In the competitive global environment, business schools may benefit from more fully exploring career competencies, such as networking skills, for increasing the appeal of EMBA programmes. The paper also draws attention to the need for HR managers to increase efforts for improving women's career competencies. Originality/value: Findings extend previous research on the development of career competencies from an EMBA, indicating the importance of developing networks, particularly at mid-career. The paper highlights the need to redefine women's mid-career stage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Age; Business Schools; Career competencies; Career development; Career stage; Competences; Executive MBA; Managers; Master of Business Administration; United Kingdom; Women; Women managers",,"Chen, A.; Cranfield University School of Management, Cranfield, United Kingdom; email: aurora.chen@cranfield.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863491053

The purpose of this paper is to fill this research gap. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used survey design and multiple regressions to analyze a sample of 650 Swedish medical doctors. Findings: Pay dispersion was found to be negatively associated with both men's and women's earnings. These effects were contingent on compensation informality and the individual's position in the pay structure. Specifically, when pay dispersion was high, high compensation informality resulted in women being paid less. The interaction of pay dispersion and compensation informality was unrelated to men's earnings. Also, women who were paid less suffered larger penalties when pay dispersion was higher, but their female counterparts who were paid more gained from the existence of greater pay dispersion. Originality/value: Examining the structure of labor markets on individual outcomes is increasing in importance due to the boundaryless nature of contemporary careers. As people cross functional, organizational, industrial, and even occupational boundaries more frequently in their career lifetimes, they are increasingly exposed to the structural effects of external labor markets.

The purpose of this paper is to understand, from an individual manager and employee perspective in the UK and USA, what personal experience individuals had on workplace romance and what this meant to them personally and in terms of company policy. Design/methodology/approach: A thematic analysis approach was taken to understand what experiences individuals had on workplace romance and how this experience should be reflected in company policy. The research utilised qualitative interviews which were preferred over other methods, such as focus groups by the participants. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded to formulate themes in the research. Findings: The sample consists of 21 employees and 15 managers from Maryland, Oregon, Pennsylvania and England. Regardless of whether participants were from the USA or England, their opinions were similar. Managers and entry level employees feel that workplace romance was acceptable if it has minimal impact on the workplace. Managers and entry level employees are most concerned with the negative impacts of workplace romance on the atmosphere of the workplace, more so than the risk of sexual harassment lawsuits. Managers and entry level employees agree on the importance of companies having a policy on how workplace romance will be handled. Practical implications: Both managers and employees stress that company policy should not place a complete ban on workplace romance; that workplace romances should be handled on a case by case basis. Originality/value: The paper adds to existing research by comparing managers' and entry level employees' perceptions of consensual romantic relationships between people who work for the same organisation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Company policy; Employee and manager romance; Employees behaviour; Interpersonal relations; Office romances; Workplace romance; Workplace sexuality",,"Biggs, D.; University of Gloucestershire, Cheltenham, United Kingdom; email: dbiggs@glos.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863461859

This growing literature provides compelling evidence against using a medical framework for understanding and responding to pedophilia, yet most people in the English-speaking world still cling to a post-World War Two construction of the pedophile as a dangerous stranger, pathologically unable to control his insatiable sexual desire for young people. This article aims to address this particular dilemma. Drawing on the work of Ann Laura Stoler, it argues that the construction of the pedophile is a vector of normalisation processes, ""a tactic in the internal fission of society into binary oppositions, and means of creating 'biologized' internal enemies, against whom society must defend itself"". As a social construction, the pedophile persists because it plays an important ideological function in modern society: it affirms the white, middle-class, 'traditional' heterosexual family as the ideal site for the production and reproduction of social and political norms. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Biopower; Homosexuality; Moral panic; Normalisation; Pedophilia",,"Chenier, E.; Department of History, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; email: echenier@gmail.com",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

Based upon an extensive personal interview with Marsh, my work uses subjective testimony to examine the complexity of lived-experience for gay men in Bundesrepublik society right at the time when the West Germany government extended full political and legal equality to gay men. Marsh's testimony details two separate incidents during which Stark, who knew Marsh was openly gay and performed as a drag queen, attacked Marsh's sexual orientation. While perhaps not significant in and of itself, a closer look at Marsh's account reveals that Stark made use of very specific social contexts in order to condemn Marsh's sexual identity. In fact, on both occasions some other social transgression entirely served as a catalyst to the confrontation, one a racial transgression and another an ethno-religious transgression. In both cases, however, Stark made use of the situation of a ""double-transgression"" to censure Marsh and his company first and foremost as homosexuals. At the same time, the sexual nature of Stark's outbursts reveals that Stark was actually concerned about the tenuous standing and respectability of his own person and household as a likewise marginalized individual in West German society. Indeed, Stark's attacks on Marsh's homosexuality were disguised attempts to assert his own position in ""respectable"" West German society at Marsh's expense. Marsh's run-ins with Stark, then, both add to the growing literature on the various forms of informal prejudice suffered by gay men in post-World War II West German society and serve as a larger lens through which to view the rich complexity of life for gay men in a country still undergoing democratization where social belonging was being negotiated along a number of fronts. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Gay life in West Germany; History of sexuality; Informal prejudice; Marginalized identity; Sexual politics; Social belonging; Transgression; West German history",,"Kurt Johnson, R.; Berlin Program for Advanced German and European Studies, Freie Universitaet, Berlin, Germany; email: rjtenvol@hotmail.com",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

Topics covered include changing sexual behavior with age, adjustment to this change, gender differences in behavior, attitudes toward commercial sex and other non-marital sexual partners, and condom use. Most respondents were aware of this change and saw a decrease in sexual activity and desire more often among women compared to men. At the same time, many respondents viewed sexuality as important to a marriage. Some respondents accepted the decrease in sexual activity and focused more on work, family and temple activities. Thai Buddhism was seen as an important resource for people who were dealing with changes due to aging. Other persons turned to other partners including both commercial and non-commercial partners. The influence of the HIV epidemic that began in the 1990s was seen in concerns about disease transmission with extramarital partners and consequent attitudes toward condom use.

This study examines the experiences of eight women on a reality television show who sought empowerment and increased self-esteem through sexualized dance. Through participant observation and reviewing video-footage and transcripts of filmed interviews, the study examines the relationship between burlesque dancing and empowerment through the experiences of these individuals.

This article maps and critically evaluates the conceptual development of this dilemma of disabled masculinity, tracing how several developments in the fields of disability studies and the critical study ofms that require attention. The most critical issue conceptually is that the focus of study has been more on masculinity and how it intersects with 'disability' as an almost generic category, rather than on how masculinity (or masculinities) intersect(s) differently with various types of impairment. Thus, though there is quite a bit of research on the dilemma of disabled masculinity for men who acquire a physical impairment post-childhood and for groups of men with diverse impairments studied as if they were a homogenous group, less research has been conducted with men who have specific impairments, particularly early-onset, intellectual or degenerative impairments. In this paper we urge researchers to open up the concept of intersectionality to accommodate a range of differences in bodily, cognitive, intellectual and behavioral types (impairments) in their interaction with various masculinities and to show more explicitly how context and life phase contribute to this dynamism. © The Author(s) 2012.","bodies; disability; hegemonic masculinity; identity; sociology",,"Shuttleworth, R.; Faculty of Health, School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia; email: r.shuttleworth@deakin.edu.au",,,1097184X,,,,"English","Men Masculin.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861928832

Drawing upon original data from forty-four key-informant interviews, this article examines how the gendered construction of women's bodies places them at particular risk. Although the gender dimensions of HIV are recognized, the gendered structures of power that underscore the particular risk to women of infection are not fully understood, and the response fails to engage effectively with the gender context. This research contributes to the literature because the body is typically located within the private sphere, beyond the realms of intervention and analysis. Taboos surrounding the body, particularly the female body, act as a barrier to understanding and addressing women's embodied experiences that place them at risk. The body is the site of risk of HIV infection, and it is the site of where power is exercised and becomes real. Where HIV spreads along the gender fault lines of society, the analysis sheds light on how women's embodied experiences of power heighten their risk and provide the space to challenge them. Rather than imposing responses from the top down based on best practice, policy must be responsive to specific gender contexts. © 2012 Taylor et Francis.","AIDS; gender; HIV; Malawi; women",,"Anderson, E.-L.; School of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy (SPIRE), Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: e.anderson@keele.ac.uk",,,14616742,,,,"English","Int.

Dance Me to My Song (hereafter Dance), is a rare exception. The film's star and co-author of its script, Heather Rose Slattery, who had cerebral palsy, did not want her film to be pigeonholed as a 'disability film'. Dance nevertheless demands that we reflect on normative and non-normative bodies and the politics of disability. In its exploration of the tensions between technology, embodiment, autonomy and intersubjectivity, Dance exceeds the (at times) utopian or programmatic accounts of cultural theory as well as the social model of disability. Reading the film only through the lens of 'social realism' and 'disability', however, limits the audience's depth of engagement with it. We argue that Dance, in its representation of romance, its use of time and its deployment of voice, should be resituated within the genre of the 'women's film'. In co-writing and performing in such an audacious film, Rose has managed to simultaneously politicise desire, normalise disability and, all the while, dancing us to her song. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Simpson, C.; Department of Environment and Geography, Macquarie UniversityAustralia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

Same-sex marriage may not challenge heteronormative and patriarchal features typically associated with marriage, and may serve to reinforce a hierarchy that promotes traditional marriage as the ideal relationship structure. This may result in only assimilationist acceptance of LGBT people. However, the consequence of inclusion to marriage ought to reflect social acceptance of LGBTs as people worthy of equal treatment in dignity and in rights, regardless of perceived differences or similarities to a supposed majority standard.

Following Charlotte Brunsdon, our study looks specifically for evidence of feminine sexual agency in these texts. The analysis reveals that Keyes's women are proactive in trying to stake out their own sexual territory in an assertive and fun-loving way.

This article explores how the rhetoric was invoked in recent same-sex marriage debates in Australia. We analyse the public submissions to the 2009 Australian government inquiry into same-sex marriage to reveal the ways in which the abstract figure of 'the child' was deployed. It became evident that heteronormativity was privileged and upheld primarily through the discourse of children's best interests. Concern about the well-being of children raised by lesbian and gay parents was the pivotal argument by those who opposed same-sex marriage. Heteronormativity was reproduced through the claim that same-sex parenting is harmful to children and thus heterosexuality was positioned as the only 'safe' place for parenting. A small number of the submissions in support of same-sex marriage also based their arguments on the best interests of the child. Typically, these submissions positioned lesbian and gay parents as 'just like' heterosexual parents and in doing so they produced an idealised homonormative couple. This unwittingly reinforces heterosexuality through the construction of an 'acceptable' domesticated homosexuality, based on adherence to heteronormativity, which effectively marginalises other family forms and sexual behaviours. We argue that the rhetorical power of the 'best interests' argument relies on the absence of the voices of actual children raised by lesbian and gay parents and that this silencing has harmful consequences for these children. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Hosking, G.; Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Flinders UniversityAustralia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

However, this article goes further to move beyond the reality-representation divide by arguing that the so-called 'reality' is also discursively constituted. We first demonstrate how the 'proper' sex act of men in Taiwan is discursively constituted through Simon and Gagnon's notion of 'sexual script'. We then show how this discursively mediated male sex in Taiwan parallels neatly with the structure of the narrative of nine Japanese bishōjo AVs featuring Yuki Maiko, a prominent Japanese AV actress. We conclude that Japanese AVs in general and bishōjo AVs in particular will garner huge popularity among Taiwanese men because they appear to these men very 'real'. That is to say, the distinction between pornographic representations of sex and the 'real' sex vanishes not because pornographic representations are getting more 'real' as Hardy has argued, but because the so-called 'real' sex is also culturally constituted. © The Author(s) 2012.","'real core'; Japanese adult video; pornography preference; representation-reality divide; sexual script; Taiwanese men",,"Yau, H.-y.; Program of International Public Policy, Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba-city, Ibaraki, Japan; email: yau.hoi-yan.ga@u.tsukuba.ac.jp",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862742940

Finally, I illustrate how becoming a cosmopolitan sexual citizen involves a set of consumptive practices that fetishise and Other non-white bodies and lives. At large global gay and lesbian events like the Gay Games, local histories and bodies are mediated as sites of consumption that affirm sexual citizens' status as global cosmopolitan citizens and define the parameters of an imagined queer world. © The Author(s) 2012.","cosmopolitan Other; Cosmopolitanism; Gay Games; neoliberalism; rights-based politics; sexual citizenship",,"Burns, K.; The University of Sydney, Sydney, 2006, Australia; email: kellie.burns@sydney.edu.au",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862733301

The relationship of childhood to sexuality is fraught with difficulties, controversies, and complexities; it is one openly and officially based on exclusion, with children constituted as requiring protection from sexuality, considered an 'adults' only' domain, dangerous to children. Hegemonic discourses of childhood and innocence are examined in the ways in which they have been utilized to strictly regulate children's access to knowledge of sexuality and to deny their relevance and access to sexual citizenship. Utilizing a Foucaultian theoretical framework, it is argued that the regulation of children's access to knowledge of sexuality is primarily linked to the ways in which childhood and innocence are utilized as a means through which the 'good' heteronormative adult citizenship subject is constituted and governed. Children's education is foundational in the development of the heteronormative good future citizen and sexual citizen subject. Through institutions such as schooling, adults have heavily regulated children's education and access to information, strictly defining what knowledge children should and should not be privy to. A focus is given to Australian primary schooling and pre-school education. Moral panic is regularly mobilized to reinforce this regulation when the boundaries of what is perceived to be 'appropriate' knowledge for children are transgressed. It is argued that this regulation has critical implications for children's early education, their increased vulnerabilities, and for their health and well-being, not just in their childhood but throughout their lives. © The Author(s) 2012.","Childhood; citizenship; education; knowledge; sexuality",,"Robinson, K.

Female undergraduate participants were asked to recall past experiences and observations of sexism, as well as their confronting behaviors. Path modeling in Study 1 (N = 148) demonstrated that women were more likely to report confronting if they believed that the confrontation would make a difference (perceived benefits), or they were less concerned about social sanctions (perceived costs), and the prediction patterns were similar for both experienced and observed sexism. Study 2 (N = 166) replicated the results of Study 1, as well as tested the moderating influence of gender identification. In situations of higher perceived social costs, women who were less strongly identified with their gender group were more responsive to the perceived benefits of the confrontation when deciding whether to confront on behalf of the self.

Two factors emerged: Appearance Congruence and Gender Identity Acceptance. TCS total and subscale scores were internally consistent. Supporting its construct validity, TCS scores were (a) positively related to life satisfaction and presence of life meaning; (b) negatively related to anxiety, depression, and body dissatisfaction; and (c) unrelated to social desirability and searching for life's meaning. TCS scores also garnered incremental validity by predicting life satisfaction, presence of meaning in life, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms above and beyond the number of steps taken to transition. Study 2 confirmed the TCS's factor structure with a sample of 342 transgender individuals.

Therefore, in this study, the authors conducted a thematic analysis of 650 photographs of Haitian women in the Associated Press Photo Archive in the years 1994-2009. The analysis comprised a two-step process: First, the authors identified coding categories through an inductive analysis of the data; later, these categories were analyzed from a feminist poststructuralist framework to generate themes that could describe how Haitian women are positioned in relation to media consumers. The three themes generated-""Negotiating Power and Resistance,"" ""Enacting Haitian Culture,"" and ""Showcasing Affliction""-delineate the media's tendency to emphasize the ""otherness"" in Haitian women, as well as to characterize this group as victims in need of rescuing by powerful others. The authors conclude by emphasizing the impact of these images on the identity of Haitian women and Women of Color, as well as on the attitudes and behaviors of media consumers toward these groups. © The Author(s) 2012.","communications media; content analysis; feminism; portrayals; poststructuralism; racial and ethnic groups; women of color",,"Rendón, M.

The sample consisted of 217 participants (mean age of 14.6) who self-identified as Latina from the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area of California in the United States. The results indicate that about a third of the sample had engaged in one or more sexual behaviors. Overall, greater usage of substances was associated with greater numbers of sexual behaviors. Girls who reported engaging in two or more sexual behaviors reported more frequent marijuana and alcohol use. The girls who reported high sexual self-efficacy engaged in few to no sexual behaviors. Additionally, parental communication, normative peer pressure, acculturation, and educational aspirations were unrelated to their sexual behavior. However, the majority of girls who reported receiving good grades also reported no sexual activity. Moreover, girls who reported no sexual behavior also reported no gang activity.

Previous research has shown that when adult women are portrayed as sexualized they are seen as less competent. In the present study we depicted a pre-teen girl in sexualized clothing to determine if similar effects would occur as have been found with depictions of adult women. One hundred sixty two male and female students from a small liberal arts college in the Midwestern U. S. looked at one of three images of a fifth-grade girl (obtained from an internet advertisement and manipulated through computer software) who was presented in either childlike clothing, somewhat sexualized clothing, or definitely sexualized clothing. Level of accomplishment was also manipulated so that the girl was described as either average or above average in accomplishment. Participants then rated the girl on ten different traits. The clothing and accomplishment manipulations significantly affected ratings of the girl's masculine-stereotyped traits such that the girl who was portrayed as more sexualized and less accomplished was seen as the least intelligent, competent, determined, and capable. In addition, the sexualized girl was seen as perhaps ""responsible"" for her sexualized clothing in that she was rated relatively low in self-respect and morality.

This article responds to Lamb and Peterson's (2011) attempts to open up and complicate the notion of 'sexual empowerment' as it is used in relation to adolescent girls. Drawing on contemporary research from the UK, New Zealand and elsewhere, the article seeks to promote a dialogue between media and communications research and more psychologically oriented scholarship. The paper makes four arguments. First it points to the need to rethink conceptualizations of the media, and processes of media influence. Secondly it raises critical questions about the notion of 'media literacy' which has increasingly taken on the status of panacea in debates about young people and 'sexualization'. Thirdly it highlights the curious absence of considerations of power in debates about sexual empowerment, and argues for the need to think about sexualization in relation to class, 'race', sexuality and other axes of oppression. Finally, it raises critical questions about the utility of the notion of sexual empowerment, given its individualistic framing, the developmentalism implicit in its use, and the difficulties in identifying it in cultures in which 'empowerment' is used to sell everything from liquid detergents to breast augmentation surgery. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Empowerment; Media; Postfeminism; Sexualization; Young women",,"Gill, R.; Centre for Culture, Media and Creative Industries, King's College London, Chesham Building, Strand Campus, London WC2R 2LS, United Kingdom; email: rosalind.gill@kcl.ac.uk",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860579316

In this theoretical paper, two feminists, who have previously expressed differing perspectives regarding adolescent girls' sexual empowerment (Lamb 2010a, b; Peterson 2010), discuss their disagreements and attempt to find some common ground in their viewpoints on girls' sexuality. A critical question related to sexual empowerment is whether empowerment includes a subjective sense of efficacy, desire, and pleasure. In other words, are girls sexually empowered if they feel that they are empowered? The authors identify three themes that make answering this question particularly challenging-age differences, exposure to sexualized media, and the pressure to please a partner. Despite these challenges, the authors identify several points of consensus, including agreeing that adequate sexuality education and media literacy education are vital to optimizing adolescent girls' sexual empowerment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescent girls; Empowerment; Feminism; Sexuality",,"Lamb, S.; Department of Counseling and School Psychology, College of Education and Human Development, UMass Boston, University of Massachusetts Boston, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125, United States; email: Sharon.lamb@umb.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860597606

While most feminists are committed to the promotion of diverse and egalitarian sexual possibilities for girls (and women), we differ in our views on how to hold an aspirational vision alongside paying attention to real world constraints on its unfolding. A specific instance of this tension is posed in considering how relevant claims to individual empowerment are within a broader context that remains broadly sexist and limiting as well as saturated with racist and other forms of discrimination and inequality. In this paper, I join the dialogue opened by Lamb and Peterson (2011) to explore some of these questions. I argue that the concept of sexual empowerment, as taken up in these debates, might be too flexible to do the work we require of it. In particular, I suggest that it is unhelpful to fix our lens on claims of individual empowerment, if and where this involves eliding the broader sociocultural conditions of possibility for ""intimate justice"" (McClelland 2010) for girls and women; and, where it leads us to over-ride the psychosocial complexity of all individuals in ways that distract us from attending to ambivalence and understanding the ""cruel attachments"" that can bind us to injustice. Rather than seeking to offer an ""'expert' view of empowerment,"" I argue for the value of reflexive, empathic, and respectful feminist critique of the cultural conditions of possibility for such a thing. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cultural critique; Feminism; Girls; Postfeminism; Sexual empowerment; Sexuality",,"Gavey, N.; Department of Psychology, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; email: n.gavey@auckland.ac.nz",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860560809

It was hypothesized that greater breast development would detrimentally influence adolescent girls' psychological well-being, although these associations were expected to be stronger for younger adolescent girls and for Whites. Results using multivariate regression analyses with robust standard errors showed that greater perceived breast development was associated with lower self-esteem and higher depressive symptoms for 13-15 year old White, African American (for self-esteem only), and Hispanic (for depressive symptoms only) girls. Although perceived breast development was not associated with 16-18 year old girls' self-esteem, supplemental analyses found that 16-18 year old Asian American and White girls with considerable or little breast development had more depressive symptoms than those with some breast development. Menarche at a younger age, overweight BMI, perceptions of being overweight, and efforts to lose weight explained a substantial portion of these associations. This study shows that greater perceived breast development, particularly if it occurs at a younger age, is a risk factor for poorer psychological well-being among adolescent girls including racial-ethnic minorities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescence; Breast development; Depressive symptoms; Physical development; Self-esteem",,"Yuan, A.

I then engage Lamb and Peterson's points of consensus about the role of sexual empowerment in adolescent girls' healthy sexuality by 1) positioning sexualization as more than a context; 2) identifying a missing discourse of gender inequity as a central issue in their discussion; and 3) explaining how the use of theory and interpretation in feminist research methods is necessary for and distinct from a surface reading of narratives of lived experience. Finally, I will provide examples of some alternative paths for supporting healthy adolescent women's sexuality that extend beyond school-based sex education and media literacy into alternative engagements with girls through technology, media activism and participatory practices. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescent girls; Empowerment; Feminism; Research methods; Sexuality",,"Tolman, D.

Burrelli, in InfoBrief: Science Resource Statistics, NSF, Washington, DC 2008), and are more likely to have exposure to negative experiences with a sexist and hostile climate (H.

As a result of these inequities many universities have implemented mentoring programs to provide equal career support for women and men in order to improve success in achieving tenure and promotion. The goal of this research is to report findings from a small interview study of female faculty in science and engineering, reporting their perceptions of their mentoring experiences and the role of gender in shaping those perceptions in an effort to gain insights that will help to make mentoring programs more effective. Three distinct types of mentoring emerged, including: (1) global mentoring, which was the most wide-ranging, involved and committed mentoring relationship; (2) formal targeted mentoring, which occurred in the context of a formal program, was aimed specifically toward providing advice and support toward attaining a career goal; and (3) informal targeted mentoring often initiated by the protégée herself. We found that the mentoring relationship is affected by the use of traditional gender ideology that supports the belief that being a woman and an engineer/scientist is not compatible, which has the potential to influence the mentoring relationship by making protégées feel more vulnerable to negative evaluation. Finally, we make a series of concrete recommendations for developers of mentoring programs to make them more supportive for women faculty.Copyright © 2012 by Begell House, Inc.","Gender in science and engineering; Mentoring",,"Dunham, C.

Because women comprise less than a fifth of engineering undergraduates, it important to identify practices that may counteract this gender gap in engineering. Unlike other work focused on recruitment and retention of women, this study relies on research and theory on college students to inform the overall research design. It explores how variations in curricular emphases, instructional practices, and students' perceptions of climate across disciplines are related to gender disparities across engineering disciplines. Data are drawn from a nationally representative survey of students from 121 programs at 31 institutions. No research to date has systematically examined the relationship between curricular experiences and gender disparity on such a large scale. Analyses clearly demonstrate differences in gender diversity across the engineering disciplines-programs in mechanical and electrical engineering are significantly less diverse by gender than biomedical/bioengineering, chemical, civil, general, and industrial engineering. Thus, efforts to recruit and retain women students should develop strategies for specific disciplines, perhaps looking beyond traditional efforts that have focused on climate and instead examining curriculum or instructional strategies. This research indicates that females may gravitate toward or persist in disciplines that emphasize thinking from a broad, systems perspective in which instructors explicitly link topics across disciplines in their courses. The less diverse electrical and mechanical engineering disciplines could place a greater emphasis on such topics as an effort to boost their attractiveness to females.

This theory has produced much debate, and many transsexuals have disagreed with it. In this research, comments about Blanchard's theory were collected through an anonymous questionnaire from a convenience sample of 170 mostly White/European Internet-using MtF transsexuals. Positive responses to the theory were given by 15.9% of participants, 31.9% gave neutral responses, and 52.2% gave negative responses. The most common theme of the responses was that the theory was too narrow and restrictive. Other common themes were that the theory was simply wrong, did not apply to the participant's experience, was not acceptable, was not important, only applied to cross-dressers, and suggested underlying motives of the researcher. Some participants reported that they had experienced autogynephilia, and some reported changes of their sexual orientation. Given the anonymity of the participants, transsexual participants were unlikely to consciously distort their responses. Although there were sampling limitations, this study lends insight into the proportion of MtF transsexuals who are supportive of/opposed to Blanchard's typology and the reasons why some are opposed to it. The findings are of interest as transsexuals' reactions to the theory can be and have been used to theorize about the nature of autogynephilia. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Autogynephilia; cross-gender eroticism; qualitative research; sexuality; transsexual",,"Veale, J.

Twenty-one MtF transgender veterans and 9 cis-gender females were enrolled. The interaction of speaking fundamental frequency (SFo) and formant (resonatory) frequencies in gender discrimination was investigated. The results indicated that an average SFo above 180 Hz and maintaining a speaking pitch range of approximately 140 to 300 Hz appear to be the most powerful acoustic features or markers in the perception of a female voice in a biological male (M. L. Brown & Rounsley, 1996). An SFo of approximately 170 Hz appears to be the lower limit that would result in a biological male being perceived as having a female voice by most listeners. A slight elevation in the second (F2) and third (F3) formants was noted but does not appear to have a significant influence in the perception of a female voice in biological males. Female voices appear to be perceived as male by most listeners if average SFo is at or below 165 Hz, the low SFo is below 130 Hz, and a low F3 is exhibited. No evidence was found that jitter (frequency perturbation) and shimmer (amplitude perturbation) affect the perception of a female or male voice in a biological male. The results support previous research that elevated pitch is the strongest acoustic marker in the perception of a female voice in biological males. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","formant; frequency; intonation; resonance; Transgender",,"King, R.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether these gender differences still exist, specifically in British and Australian business students, or whether there has been a generation shift in attitudes. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative data were analysed from 481 (252 females and 229 males) university students, on their responses to what they ""expected"" to earn five years after graduation and what they thought they ""deserved"" to earn. Students from two British universities (n=285) and two Australian universities (n=196) participated. Findings: Results revealed that the presence of very high values (outliers) reported by a small proportion of male respondents led to apparent gender differences in perceived entitlement (deserved salary). However, appropriately modified analyses showed no significant gender differences in expected salary, deserved salary or salary difference. Differences were observed between countries; in the UK expectations and views on deserved salary were higher than those expressed in Australia. In addition, in both countries' students from higher ranking universities expected higher salaries and believed they deserved a higher salary. Research limitations/implications: The sample is restricted to University business students and may not generalise to other groups. Practical implications: Implications of these findings reflect on gender pay inequities, along with methodological issues for future research. Originality/value: This paper challenges the long-held view that, in general, males have more positive expectations of their future salaries than females. While this has been reported in the past, the paper illustrates that in a contemporary sample across two countries, the great majority of male and female students had very similar expectations for their future salary. The paper proposes some explanations that may account for this phenomenon. The only clear gender difference observed was the presence of a small proportion of males with extremely high salary expectations; the paper highlights the necessity for appropriate statistical analysis of such highly skewed data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Australia; Gender; Pay; Students; United Kingdom",,"Davidson, M.

It examines how midlife women account for their transition from organizations to self-employment; why they opted for self-employment rather than simply changing organizations and their experience of self-employment. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on semi-structured interviews (n=100), with women between the ages of 46 and 60 who have moved into self-employment from organizational employment. Findings: Two themes emerged from the study. The first was the negative organizational experience of some of the women which had caused dissatisfaction and disenchantment and therefore self-employment was seen as the only next step. The second theme was changes triggered by a positive proactive choice to move into self-employment. Research limitations/implications: There are limitations to using individual perceptions and anecdotes. It cannot be assumed that the women in this study represent the views of all midlife women. Practical implications: Silence about midlife women leaving organizations perpetuates high costs for both the organization and the individual involved. Organizations need to address the negative and discriminatory perceptions about midlife women and recognize the trend towards more, not fewer, older women in the workplace and value the experience, skills and knowledge they bring. Originality/value: The paper is original in that the focus is on women in midlife, which is unique, as previous research about women in organizations has rarely encompassed the experiences of this group of women moving into self-employment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurialism; Midlife; Self-employment; Women; Women entrepreneurs",,"Hodges, J.; Newcastle University Business School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom; email: julie.hodges@ncl.ac.uk",,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860385370

Several factors have been found to account for this, an important one being women's responsibilities for home and family functioning, often resulting in work-family conflict (WFC). The purpose of this paper is to examine correlates and consequences of WFC among a sample of managerial and professional women working in Istanbul, Turkey. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 143 women, most working in the public sector, using anonymously completed questionnaires. About half were married and about half had children. WFC, both work interfering with family and family interfering with work (time-, strain- and behaviour-based) were measured by a scale developed and validated by Carlson et al., in a US study. Findings: The respondents indicated relatively low levels of WFC. Levels of work interfering with family and family interfering with work were significantly and positively correlated. Hierarchical regression analyses, controlling for both personal demographic and work situation characteristics, showed that WFC generally predicted both work and psychological well-being outcomes, work interfering with family being a consistently stronger predictor of these than was family interfering with work. Research limitations/implications: Data collected at one point in time make it difficult to examine causality. In addition, most respondents worked in the public sector, raising the issue of generalizability to women managers and professionals in the private sector. Practical implications: Practical implications are offered for individuals, families and workplaces to address work-family issues.

Examining these e-mails in some depth, we unpack the role of humour in subverting various forms of control, including gender norms and managerial authority. We find the relation between humour, control and subversion to be ambiguous. Building upon current debates in organization studies, we develop the concept of humour based on our observations at Keys. Specifically, we argue that humour is always in excess of both control and subversion, a 'nicely impossible' object that cannot be captured. This article thus contributes to theoretical approaches on organizational humour, conceptualizing the concept of 'newness' through Judith Butler's re-reading of Derridean différance and the Lacanian Real.

The article discusses findings from a critical discursive and contextual emotional labour perspective, taking into account organizational and institutional factors as well as social structural dimensions of gender and social class. It shows how discourses on emotion, constructed through articulation of personal experiences of service usage both reflected and constructed the ideological and structural positionings of women service users, while emotional discourse - displays of anger in user involvement forums - worked to constitute traditionally male and ideologically masculine elements of the field, as well as the working-class identities of some participants. These forms of emotion work, and the ways in which they elicited further emotion management from service users and workers alike, are located in relation to the rules of engagement of user involvement and the bureaucratic institutional forms within which this took place. The article concludes that the emotion work of user involvement ultimately helped to reproduce the dominant institutional and social order, including its gender and class dimensions.

To do so we examine some of the specific discursive mechanisms that sustain low pay. We show that aged care employers actively reproduce a familial logic of care that represents paid aged care work as unskilled and natural for women and therefore not deserving of higher pay.

In 1996 the UN declared Sweden to be the most gender-equal country in the world. However, women still take much more responsibility for children and domestic work than men do, leading to the reproduction of gender inequality in the labour market and in society at large. A causal mechanism is used to analyse this phenomenon, starting from the observation that men are on average three years older than women and thus already have a stronger position on the labour market when a heterosexual couple is formed. This increases the risk that the woman will lose the first negotiations on how to divide household and wage labour when they have children. This will in turn lead to increasing returns for the man, increasing the risk that she will lose subsequent negotiations about the division of labour. What seems to be a rational arrangement for both (increasing the total income for the family) results in the reproduction of gender inequality.

She concurred with contemporary economists who rejected the hoarding of money as detrimental to the national economy and regarded aristocratic prodigality as a driving force for trade. As her rakes well understand, the true utility of money consists in allowing them to acquire desirable goods, whose perceived value is subjective, depending on the difference in usefulness to the consumers. Her rakes frequently speak of themselves as both buyers and sellers of (sexual) merchandise, thereby blurring the difference between the genders and classes. Both women and men in her comedies are commodified and commodify themselves, laying out their charms like luxury wares.

It begins by positioning the Swedish feminist zine community within the larger context of so-called 'second and third wave feminisms' but argues at the same time that it is important to break with traditional feminist chronologies, and resist reductive generational narratives of feminist movement history. On the basis of this particular empirical case the article introduces an analytic of sexual logics as an alternative for analysing feminist discourse. From here the article goes on to investigate how the notion of Sisterhood has come to serve as an empty signifier within this specific community. It concludes with a more general discussion of the function of empty signifiers in relation to recent feminist discussions of Sisterhood. © The Author(s) 2012.","Activism; alternative media; discourse; empty signifier; feminist movement; logics; Riot Grrrl; Sisterhood; third wave; zines",,"Payne, J.

The grip that 'sexualisation' has on the public imagination may be due less to the social problems it identifies, and more to how it serves as a repository of disavowed or unacknowledged parts of our (social) selves.

Asking not are girls being prematurely sexualised but how can this debate be understood as a feature of time and place and how does it relate to the lives of girls as they approach puberty and their first sexual experience? In a parallel approach to other commentaries on sexualisation, the paper takes a deconstructionist approach to recurrent themes of the debate such as the ideal of childhood innocence/protection, to provide an interpretive lens for understanding the emergence of a public concern that places girls at the centre. In doing so, the paper considers four ways of looking: the impact of second-wave feminism; the increased sexualisation of culture; the erotic potential of girls; and the lived experience of girlhood, as perspectives offering some explanatory power for present times. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","childhood innocence; girlhood; girls as sexual subjects; sexualisation of girls; young female sexuality",,"Kehily, M.

In this study, exposure to fat talk from peers was experimentally manipulated to determine the effect of hearing fat talk on a woman's own likelihood of engaging in fat talk and on state body dissatisfaction, guilt, and sadness. Undergraduate women (n = 87; all of a healthy weight) from a Midwestern university in the United States participated in a study ostensibly about discussing magazine advertisements. Two female confederates were present for the discussion. While discussing an advertisement featuring an attractive and thin female model, participants either heard both confederates engage in fat talk, neither confederate engage in fat talk, or the first engage in fat talk and the second challenge the fat talk. Hearing a confederate fat talk made the participants more likely to fat talk themselves (especially if the fat talk went unchallenged) and increased participants' self-reported state body dissatisfaction and guilt. Participants who engaged in fat talk reported higher levels of self-reported state body dissatisfaction and guilt, compared to participants who did not engage in fat talk (even when controlling for pre-existing trait body dissatisfaction). Participant fat talk mediated the effect of condition on both state body dissatisfaction and guilt. Additionally, correlational analyses revealed that participants with higher levels of trait body dissatisfaction (assessed at a pre-test) were more likely to engage in fat talk (regardless of condition). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Body dissatisfaction; Body image; Fat talk",,"Salk, R.

Racial minorities tend to idealize larger bodies than Whites and so might respond differently to advertising influences. We investigated whether exposure to idealized portrayals of male and female bodies in TV advertisements has different effects on men of different race/ethnicity. Additionally, we investigated whether implicit methods reveal different results than self-reports. One hundred and sixty Asian, Hispanic, and White American male undergraduates from a university in California (USA) were randomly assigned to watch TV advertisements portraying thin women, muscular men, or watched no ads. Their implicit self-esteem was measured using the Implicit Association Test, and a questionnaire assessed explicit self-esteem, actual-ideal body discrepancy, and perception of weight-related health-risks. Exposure to portrayals of muscular men decreased actual-ideal body discrepancy in all men. Exposure to portrayals of thin women increased men's implicit but not explicit self-esteem in Asian and Hispanic men only. Both these findings are consistent with a self-enhancing role of exposure to idealized male and female bodies in advertising, which is often referred to as a ""fantasy effect"". This study provides evidence that media exposure interacts with culturally local body ideals and so can produce varying effects in different racial/ethnic groups. This result could have important implications for interventions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Advertising exposure; Asian; Fantasy effect; Hispanic; Implicit self-esteem; Men; Self-enhancement; White",,"Skorek, M.; Psychological Sciences, University of California, Merced, 5200 N Lake Road, Merced, CA 95344, United States; email: mskorek@ucmerced.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859216235

Exploring the Gendered Nature of Weight Bias."" They argued that fat women in North America experience significantly more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do, marshaled evidence to support their argument in several domains (e. g., employment, education, romantic relationships, health care, the media), and wondered why feminist scholars have not paid much attention to the oppression of fat women. Here I suggest several reasons why fat women experience more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do: the objectification of women, gender-related aspects of health behavior and knowledge about health and illness, and the importance of self-control to the performance of femininity. I also suggest that there is some overlap in negative stereotypes of both feminists and fat women, which might lead to a desire to distance oneself from both. However, feminists should recognize the intersectionality of fat oppression and the way it colludes with the sexualization and objectification of women in popular culture. Thus, fat should be a feminist issue. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Fat stigma; Fat women; Feminism; Self-control; Self-regulation; Weight bias; Women and weight",,"Chrisler, J.

And yet, different feminist scholars see fat as a feminist issue for radically different reasons. An analysis of mainly U. S. research suggests that for some, fat is a symptom of underlying distress and compulsive eating as a coping mechanism for this gendered anguish. For others, higher rates of ""obesity"" among poor women and women of color is a scandalous form of environmental injustice necessitating policy interventions to combat obesity in these populations. Others have argued that fat is a feminist issue because the fear of being or becoming fat tyrannizes average-size and relatively thin women, limiting their quality of life and often leading to eating disorders. In contrast, Fikkan and Rothblum (2011) argue that fat is a feminist issue because fat women are subjugated to bias, discrimination and abuse precisely because they are fat women. Unlike other approaches, they put actual fat women at the heart of their analysis, comparing their experience to that of both thin women and to fat men. They rightly signal the importance of examining how the social experiences of fat people vary by sex, social class, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation, among other factors. While emphasizing the importance of their perspective, this article advocates that this line of feminist analysis be pushed even further. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Fat; Feminism; Obesity",,"Saguy, A.; Women's Studies Department, UCLA, 264 Haines Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1551, United States; email: saguy@soc.ucla.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859217716

However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n = 115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n = 74), Hispanic/Latina (n = 52), and African American (n = 42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Attitudes; Body image; Ethnicity; Gender; Older adults; Thin-ideal internalization",,"Haboush, A.; Department of Psychology, University of Nevada, 4505 Maryland Parkway, Box 455030, Las Vegas, NV 89154-5030, United States; email: Amanda.Haboush@unlv.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859217031

Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents data from five case study companies. The key methods of data collection were 88 semi-structured interviews coupled with lengthy time spent on observation at each company, leading to an ethnographically-informed method. Findings - The key contribution of this paper is to analyse the relationships between migrant workers and the British workers they work alongside in the context of the EU expansion. It shows how low levels of English language skills lead migrant workers into low skilled roles, and that in the workplace this leads to hostility from British workers. However, as migrant workers had mainly sought employment through an agency, the case study companies actually accentuated differences between workers, and this paper examines why they act in this manner, and analyses the effects this has on workplace relations. Originality/value - This paper provides an original contribution to the equality and diversity literature as it analyses workplace relations in the context of the EU expansion of 2004. In addition to providing new empirical data for academics, it will also be of value for policy makers, particularly with regard to legislation relating to agency work, and also to management practitioners who have a diverse workforce.

However, in this current age of austerity we are witnessing a number of existing and proposed “fairness initiatives” feeling the sharp blade of a costcutting axe. This paper is a reflexive response that aims to examine a piece of action research in the field of industrial relations. It aims to take the professional UK association, the British Universities Industrial Relations Association (BUIRA), as a case study and consider how issues of equality and diversity have been viewed by the organisation both in theory and practice. Using a framework which acknowledges the need for multiple levels of analysis (macro, meso and micro) and which argues for an intersectional approach, the paper seeks to detail the measures adopted by BUIRA so as to augment its organisational responsiveness to various equality and diversity concerns. It also provides an insight into how the authors, as equality and diversity academics, reflected on the process of creating policy through their own research activities. A further aim of the paper is to highlight the scope and character of equality and diversity initiatives undertaken by BUIRA, and to discuss some of their implications for its membership – both now and in the future. What began as a simple policy piece of research developed into a multimethod, quantitative and qualitative, actionbased project. It also became a reflexive study of how and by what methods research is conducted. A quantitative and qualitative survey of BUIRA members was followed with interviews with pastpresidents of the organisation. Historical data in the form of a comprehensive 2010 retrospective on BUIRA were also consulted. The authors' empirical material was analysed with reference to a theoretical framework that acknowledges the importance of intersectionality at all levels of analysis. The study's findings are discussed in relation to macro, meso and micro influences and reference is made to how these three levels intersect in examining views and perceptions in relation to equality and diversity within BUIRA. The main findings are that while BUIRA as an association has acted to combat perceptions that it is dominated by older White men who prioritise traditional elements of industrial relations (IR), this view still persists for some of the membership. The membership survey indicated that it was female, younger or less established academics in particular who held this view, suggesting that in challenging inequalities within the IR academic community BUIRA may still have a way to go. A key implication is that representative organisations such as professional associations need to consider equality and diversity aspects that reflect the membership they serve. This has been acknowledged as fundamental in both workplaces and trade unions and now requires similar commitment from professional associations. Of course, the scope and character of initiatives are also contextsensitive, as reflected by nonlinear progress in equality initiatives undertaken by these and other organisations. The research offers an analysis of equality and diversity within a professional association which is an under researched area. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Diversity; Diversity management; Equality; Industrial relations; Professional association; Reflexivity",,,,,20407149,,,,"English","Equal.

However, the role of gender in the relationship between gossip and friendship has not been examined in the literature. So, the present study examined gender differences in the relationship between friendship quality and gossip tendency with a sample of 167 female and 69 male Western Canadian undergraduate University students using the Friendship questionnaire and the Tendency to Gossip questionnaire. Given gender differences in friendship, with males being more agentic and females more communal, the relationship between gossip and friendship was predicted to be stronger in the males compared to the females. Friendship quality was positively correlated with gossip tendency in the males, but this effect was not present with the females. The information gossip scale was strongly associated with male friendship quality. This finding may be related to the greater emphasis on status with males, and that possession of knowledge and control of information is a method of attaining status. Physical appearance gossip was found to be more prevalent in females, but not related to friendship quality. This type of gossip may be a more of a competitive threat to the relationship in females. Achievement related gossip was also related to male friendship quality, which reflects the greater emphasis on individuation in male friendships. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Friendship; Gender differences; Gossip; Social networks",,"Watson, D.

During the nineteenth century, Saint-Pierre was known as the ""Sodom"" of the Antilles, as a cosmopolitan city where decadence and liberal sexual mores were at the heart of bourgeois and elite culture. In 1902 Mount Pelée, the volcano that sits just above the city, erupted-killing Saint-Pierre's population of over thirty thousand within five seconds. Today, the black, volcanic sand beaches that line the coast remind visitors to Saint-Pierre of the city that once was. Sainte-Anne is a town with a far different reputation. During the 1950s it was known as a refuge for rebels, for people who contested the continued dominance of white and mixed-race elites in the lives of ordinary (mostly black) Martinicans, and was the center of the island's small cultural nationalist movement. Nearly fifty years later, the town retains that reputation-but Sainte-Anne is known for another reason, too, for it is home to one of Martinique's few meeting spaces for men who have sex with men, a secluded section at the end of the commune's most popular beach, Les Salines. This essay seeks to cross temporal, scalar, and disciplinary boundaries while revisiting tropes of queer invisibility that mark representations of same-sex desire in the Caribbean. Cycling from the world described in the 1901 erotic novel Une nuit d'orgie á Saint-Pierre, Martinique to field notes taken in 2010 among men who frequent Les Salines, this essay unites, in a provisional way, a scattered archive of same-sex desire on the island, while relating these desires critically to place. These archives ask us to reconsider a narrative that insists on movement-away from Martinique, away from the Caribbean, away from the global South-as the grounding force for a radical queer (of color) politics. Instead of privileging diasporic subjectivities, these markers of local presence and emplacement offer an alternative framing of what it means to stay put. They give us access to modes of queer relationality that resist documentation, but are indicative of the kinds of lives that certain subjects live: shot through with ambiguity and grounded in a refusal of fixed identity politics. Sand emerges as a compelling metaphor for this kind of theoretical and ethnographic intervention, as its ability to be diffuse yet still irreducibly material provides a model for one way to understand the memory of same-sex desire and gender transgression. Making use of fragments, then, this essay thinks simultaneously through the sexual politics of memory and landscape, linking queer presence to the sands of both Saint-Pierre and Sainte-Anne. © 2012 by Duke University Press.",,,"Agard-Jones, V.; New York UniversityUnited States",,,10642684,,,,"English","GLQ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859390844

Although the concept of social death gives us information about the condition of the slave, it also helps inform the contours of the structural position of blackness well after the formal end of slavery. The essay focuses on the relationship between novel's protagonist, Joss, a black Scottish transman, and his son, Colman, and the potential offered by queer subjectivity to imagine possibilities denied by the heteropatriarchial nation-state. Joss's queerness exposes the impossibility of black manhood to occupy a position of liberal citizenship and Colman's recognition of the structural vulnerability of diasporic black manhood brought to his attention in his realization of Joss's queerness. The improvisational element of jazz enables Joss to perform and achieve his black masculinity, and that improvisation opens up space for Colman to accept femininity as an insurgent possibility for black manhood. © 2012 by Duke University Press.",,,"Richardson, M.; Departments of English and African and African Diaspora Studies, Center for Gender and Women's Studies, University of Texas, Austin, United States",,,10642684,,,,"English","GLQ",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859390448

But the Atlantic is by no means the only or most important body of water whose currents have moved African diaspora history. If Africans' forced Atlantic passage ushered in a colonial era that violently connected Africa and the Americas to Europe, Africans' travel to and on the Pacific as sailors, soldiers, dockworkers, and curious voyagers traced other kinds of crossings: linkages between black Atlantic subjects and Mexico, Native America, Polynesia, Micronesia, the Philippines, and other sites of flow through the global South. ""Water, Shoulders, Into the Black Pacific"" looks to innovate discussions of the African diaspora by tracing one possible route of this less-explored oceanography. Where does the black Atlantic meet the black Pacific? What would it mean to chart a story of the African diaspora not through the triangle trade crisscrossing that first ocean but as a continual navigation of many bodies of water-Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Mississippi, Pacific-and many waves of migration? These are some of the questions explored in this work of historical fiction, which draws from oral histories to imagine intersections of migration, work, and desire experienced by African/Haitian American women who came from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Richmond, California, to work in Kaiser's shipyards during World War II. Narrating erotic encounters between black female shipbuilders, the piece meditates on the changing and repeating meanings of shipmate relationships between African diasporics, and choosing fiction as the space to explore these relationships, experiments with how imaginative work can destabilize and ""queer"" received stories of race, nationality, gender, and sexuality. © 2012 by Duke University Press.",,,"Tinsley, O.

While the gravity model and push/pull perspective ignore the dynamics of the migratory course, we use the cumulative causation of migration theory to conceptualize social expectations for out-migration and social resources from migrant networks in destinations. Four major findings are drawn from this demographic analysis based on microdata from China's 2000 Census. First, as suggested by the cumulative migration theory, greater previous out-migration significantly increases subsequent out-migration, a process that appears to be independent of push factors. Second, foreign direct investment (FDI) contributes to attracting rural labor migrants from other provinces to peri-urban areas as it does to cities. Third, social resources from migrant networks play an important role in attracting rural labor migrants to both city and noncity destinations. Fourth, the importance of wage differentials declines in gravitating rural labor migrants to peri-urban areas. These findings provide tentative evidence that rural labor migration is indispensable during initial peri-urbanization. Infused with flows of FDI and entrepreneurial local governments, rural migration has created a favorable initial condition for peri-urbanization.",,,"Hao, L.; Johns Hopkins University, Renmin University of ChinaChina",,,21620555,,,,"English","Chin.

Furthermore, I argue that male speech creates and complicates hierarchical relationships between men and women in the novel. Taking into account the relative economic affluence in England following World War II, I also look at how these economic and social issues influenced changing working-class masculine ideals and responsibilities in England at that time. © 2012 by the Men's Studies Press, LLC.","Alan Sillitoe; angry young men; British; masculinity; performativity; speech",,"Lewis, D.; Metropolitan Community CollegeUnited States; email: ddlewis@mccneb.edu",,,10608265,,,,"English","J.

Despite the potential for safe-sex communication to contribute to safer sex, little is known about the predictors of this form of sexual communication. Research on condom assertiveness-the unambiguous messaging that sex without a condom is unacceptable-is especially rare. This study employed the Expanded Health Belief Model (EHBM) in an attempt to understand why some collegiate females are more condom assertive than others. Compared with less condom-assertive females, more condom-assertive females have more faith in the effectiveness of condoms, believe more in their own condom communication skills, perceive that they are more susceptible to STIs, believe there are more relational benefits to being condom assertive, believe their peers are more condom assertive, and intend to be more condom assertive. Overall, EHBM variables accounted for nearly 70% of the variability in condom assertiveness. Several of these associations, however, were moderated by sexual compulsivity and general assertiveness. Implications of these findings for sexual health practitioners are discussed, and directions for future research are suggested. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","condom; condom assertiveness; condom communication; Health Belief Model; HIV; Safe sex; safe-sex communication; sexual compulsivity; sexually transmitted infections",,"Wright, P.

However, an overrepresentation of Caucasian populations existed in MRE research resulting in a need to understand how MRE is received by those in underserved populations. The current study reports the findings derived from focus groups consisting of Hispanic individuals and couples who attended and completed 20 hours of MRE using a PREP-based curriculum. Participants were asked five questions regarding differences they perceived in their relationships as a result of attending the MRE program. While participants agreed that they had learned and acquired new communication skills, they also reported substantial changes in the amount of peace and calm in their homes as well as increased understanding of and patience toward their partners. Additionally, participants reported sharing what they had learned in the MRE with family members who were not in attendance. This seemed to represent an effort to ""pay it forward"" to their loved ones. This study suggests that the benefits of MRE for these Hispanic families were felt well beyond those who actually attended the MRE program. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","couples; Hispanic; MRE; PREP; relationship education",,"Daire, A.

Drawing on surveys, policy documents, media responses, and interviews, the study explores how the phenomenon of cross-border marriage in Korea coincides with changing demographic trends and policies in the domains of the family, population, and welfare. Beginning as a solution to the ""rural bachelor's marriage problem"" - visible in the late 1980s - marriage between Korean men and women of foreign origin became increasingly common in the 2000s, in parallel with the emergence of national policy issues such as low fertility and a care deficit. The study suggests that current trends in cross-border marriage and policies on multicultural families reflect the need for changes in the organization of social reproduction that has resulted from the economic development that began in the 1960s and the political-economic restructuring since the 1990s. © 2012 IAFFE.","Cross-border marriages; Feminization of migration; Marriage migration; Multicultural family; Population and care deficit; Social reproduction",,"Lee, H.; Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore, 469A Tower Block 3 10-01, Bukit Timah Road, Singapore 259770, Singapore; email: arilho@nus.edu.sg",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

In particular, the authors ask how and how much per capita income and gender inequality matter in shaping patterns of human trafficking. Ordinal log it regressions corrected for sample selection bias show that trafficking has an inverse U-shaped relationship with income per capita, and, controlling for income per capita, trafficking is more likely in countries with higher shares of female-to-male income.

The findings show, first, that individual income differences in the country of residence cannot sufficiently explain why foreign national women remit less than men in absolute terms. Second, men who are naturalized citizens remit far less than men who are foreign nationals. Thus, in the group of naturalized German citizens, gender differences in the amount of remittances disappear. This can be explained by the fact that acquisition of citizenship makes family reunification in Germany more likely. Third, network structures in the country of origin might help to explain differences between men and women and between foreign nationals and naturalized citizens in the amount remitted. © 2012 IAFFE.","Foreigners; Gender; Naturalized residents; Remittances",,"Holst, E.; DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr.48, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; email: eholst@diw.de",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

First, it discusses the connections between globalization and the multiplicity of processes that have contributed to international migration and its feminization, arguing that gender awareness is crucial to understanding these processes. Gender analysis makes visible the increasing com modification of care work on a global scale and highlights how the organization of families is changing. Second, it analyzes the various avenues through which migration may contribute to or hinder economic development, highlighting why remittances, in particular by women, have featured very positively in the migration and development policy discourse. Third, it discusses how issues of citizenship affect the migrant population, showing how gender analysis highlights many challenges with regard to nation-based notions of citizenship, particularly in the receiving countries. © 2012 IAFFE.","Development; Gender; Globalization; Governance; International migration",,"Benería, L.; City and Regional Planning, Cornell University, West Sibley Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853, United States; email: lb21@cornell.edu",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

The current global crisis has affected these dynamics, particularly in Spain, which is one of the main destination countries for Ecuadorian migrants. A preliminary analysis of the impact of the crisis reveals an important decline in immigrant employment, but one that has not translated into a proportional decrease in remittances.

This produces an imagined, Occidentalist 'authenticity' that frames expectations about the performances and identities of Western men in the context. As a result, sojourning Western men in Asia may feel, and be treated, like 'superheroes', because their gendered national identities are attributed (super)powers that are often unfamiliar from prior experiences in their home countries. These object (attributed) identities may be different from individuals' subject (appropriated) identities, with resulting identity tensions for the men themselves. This article reports on empirical, qualitative research from China, and examines the lived realities and identity/masculinity constructions of seven young, heterosexual men, from the UK, the US and Canada, working in Shanghai as English language teachers. The study participants experienced perceptions of increased personal and sexual confidence but also identity tensions, concerns that relationships may be transactional and ethical struggles over peer-sanctioned and locally expected behaviours. The study is framed by literature from tourism studies on the commoditization of identities through the staging of out-group notions of 'authenticity'.

Featuring a thematic analysis of interviews and a focus group with farmwomen from Ontario, Canada, the research examines farms and farming as unique places and spaces of care. Informed by the literature on emotional geographies, the article examines how care is situated and performed through farmwomen's negotiation of multiple, overlapping identities and how these are embodied and affective in emotional work. The findings not only confirm the paramount role of women in rural care, they demonstrate the interdependence of family, community and work as central to the challenges of rural women's health. The article argues that the link between health and productivity on the farm is crucial to understanding farmwomen's caring, and highlights the paradox that their emotional work is as much about opportunities for power and resistance as it is about obligation and subordination. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","caring; emotional work; farm; rural health; women's health","health care; perception; rural population; sustainability; womens health; womens status; Canada; Ontario [Canada]","Skinner, M.

Feminist research has confronted masculinist discourses of mining by questioning the naturalisation of men as industrial workers, and by illustrating the gender-selective impacts of capitalist mining projects. The article probes the sources of these masculinist discourses of mining and reinterprets these critiques. Most importantly, by highlighting the diverse range of extractive practices that reflect different stages of surplus accumulation, it encourages a rethinking of mining itself as an area of feminine work. Finally, it makes tentative suggestions as to how the field of women and mining might be examined and addressed by contemporary feminists. A postcapitalist feminist critique of mining would hinge upon revealing women's agency in mining and revisit the conventional definitions of mining as industrial work and begin to see the feminine livelihoods in mining. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender; informal mining; mining impacts; mining technology; representations; women","gender relations; industrial technology; mining industry; womens employment; womens organization; womens status","Lahiri-Dutt, K.; Resource Management in the Asia Pacific Program, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The Australian National University, ACT 0200, Canberra, Australia; email: kuntala.lahiri-dutt@anu.edu.au",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859635716

Implementing legal changes to benefit women in Ethiopia is impeded by difficulties in using the formal legal system, by poverty and deeply embedded gender inequalities, by plural legal systems, and by entrenched cultural norms. However, the article argues that the most significant challenge is the increasing degree of authoritarianism in Ethiopian state politics, that this is crucial in determining the space for activism, and that this shapes the successful implementation of legal change. The research shows how women's activism around personal rights challenges public/private and personal/political boundaries and can be seen as a political threat by governments in contexts where democracy and rule of the law are not embedded, leading to repression of women's activism and hindering the implementation of measures to protect women's rights when states become more authoritarian. Little is known empirically about the impact of democratisation on the implementation of measures to protect women's rights in Africa. This article shows how the emergence of democracy and legal reform intersects with the emergence of women's rights, especially with respect to gender-based violence. It shows how trying to secure women's personal right to be free from violence through the law is profoundly political and argues that the nature of democratisation really matters in terms of the implementation of measures such as legal changes designed to protect women's rights. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","activism; Ethiopia; legal reform; violence against women; women's rights","authoritarianism; civil rights; democracy; democratization; gender relations; implementation process; legal rights; legal system; political boundary; political relations; state-local relations; violence; womens status; Ethiopia","Burgess, G.

This article seeks to contribute to this work by considering how bodies touch themselves, or what I have termed 'intra-body touching', through an interrogation of two over-life-sized paintings (Branded and Propped) by the artist Jenny Saville. Her paintings present the topographies of a female fleshy body through detailed observations of bodily surfaces and orifices which include breasts hanging, hands grabbing and fat rolling and pressing upon itself. In drawing upon Luce Irigaray's critical engagement with Merleau-Ponty's account of hands touching, the article seeks to utilise her notion of the mucous for highlighting the 'morpho-logics' of sexed and sized bodies as they are produced through the example of intra-body touching. A focus upon the embodied spatialities of intra-body touching challenges accounts of the female body that centre upon women being located in a position of estrangement and distance from its varied materialities. Instead it will suggest that Saville's bodies are centred upon distinctly geographical relations of proximity and intimacy in ways which surprise and challenge our understandings of what a fleshy body can do. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","'the body'; fat; Irigaray; Jenny Saville; materiality; touch","art; body shape; body size; fat; material culture","Colls, R.; Science Laboratories, Durham University, Department of Geography, Durham, DH1 3LE, United Kingdom; email: rachel.colls@durham.ac.uk",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859652221

To establish the relevance of boyhood gender nonconformity and parental disapproval of self-expression in gay men's lives, gay participants' (n = 136) scores on these variables were first compared with the scores of a similar sample of young heterosexual men (n = 56) and then linked to reports of public self-consciousness, covering, and anxious affect measured over the course of nine days. As hypothesized, gay men reported experiencing these developmental stressors to a higher degree than their heterosexual peers. The best fitting path model in the sample of gay men established the mediating role of daily public self-consciousness and sexual orientation covering in the relationship between parental disapproval of self-expression and daily anxiety. This final model connects etiological models of anxiety to the developmental stressors faced by some gay men. The results suggest routes through which gay-related stress may begin earlier in development than commonly assumed, while continuing to impact gay men's open self-expression, and ultimately their experience of anxiety, into young adulthood.

To understand these disparities, it is important to examine all the risk factors for this population, particularly the gay hypermasculine norms that are theorized to differ from traditional masculine ideology. The present study examined the relation between masculinity and mental health problems in an analysis of the demographic variables (i.e., age, race or ethnicity, and HIV status), mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and hostility), and conceptions of masculinity (i.e., defined as physical appearance, as social behavior, and as sexual behavior) in a sample of 311 gay and bisexual men recruited from New York City gyms. The study found that participants had elevated levels of depression compared to nonclinical norms; men who did not know their HIV status also reported the highest levels of depression. Approximately half of participants adhered to one of the hypermasculine norms, and adherence was uniform across age groups, racial or ethnic groups, and men of different HIV statuses. Significant associations were found among the three mental health symptom clusters and conceptions of masculinity defined as a social behavior and as a sexual behavior.

Yet explanations remain largely elusive. One area in which the shift from documentation to explanation has occurred is victim gender. Williams, Demuth, and Holcomb (2007) demonstrate that the death penalty is more likely to be imposed on behalf of women and girls because such victims are more apt to be sexually degraded. We ask the next logical question: Why does sexual degradation lead to the ultimate state sanction? Is it simply because such cases are so horrific? Or are more subtle causal mechanisms at play? Our findings indicate that the relationship between sexual degradation and the District Attorney's decision to seek the death penalty is fully explained by media coverage. The role of the media suggests that scholars who hope to explain disparities in capital punishment must consider the interplay between case attributes and broader social institutions. © The Author(s) 2012.","capital punishment; gender; media",,"Phillips, S.; Department of Sociology and Criminology, University of Denver, Sturm Hall 446, 2000 E.

If dominance feminism is the 'theory of no' to heterosexuality's male gender power, and if queer theory is the 'theory of yes' to the defiant possibilities of sex, sex-positive feminism is a 'theory of maybe': it examines practices of gender and sexuality in multiple contexts to find the ways in which heterosexuality can sometimes reify, and other times resist, the transfer of eroticised dominance and submission to political practices of patriarchy. After tracing the split between feminism and queer theory and arguing for a 'sex-positive queer feminism', I use the example of prostitution to consider some theoretical and practical implications of this shift in feminist lenses. © The Author(s) 2012.","prostitution; queer theory; radical feminism; sex wars; sex work; sex-positive feminism",,"Showden, C.

It then suggests that these diverging perspectives on embodied femininity result from fundamentally different second wave and third wave theories of power.

Instead of viewing the market and the gift in a binary way, I argue that Irigaray examines the conditions of possibility for transvaluing value and exchange as such. By way of an internal critique of economic texts and discourses, Irigaray draws out the available conceptual resources for the possibility of a model of exchange between two positively valued - sexuate - subjects. In this article I focus on the texts where Irigaray explicitly engages with key components of political economy - 'Commodities among Themselves', 'Women on the Market' and 'Women, the Sacred and Money' - and also her conceptualisation of a nonmarket economy in Elemental Passions.

The second section considers the importance of temporality and the interruption of the ""seamless"" thinking subject for the emergence of a maternal subject and considers Baraitser's maternal subject in relation to some key queer and feminist positionings of maternity. The final section assesses the text's contribution to philosophical debates. First, it discusses how Baraitser attends to the everyday in developing an aesthetics of ordinariness. Second, it looks at deconstruction and inhabitation. Finally, it considers cultural phenomenology, objects, and the magic Baraitser locates in things.

The author argues that Baraitser's approach foregrounds the ""maternal encounter"" in a way that is distinctive both with regard to mainstream philosophy and with regard to hegemonic versions of feminism. The text is also singular in its style and enactment of a more personalized experience of motherhood, which is nonetheless simultaneously articulated through a subtle and powerful reading of contemporary philosophy, most especially through the work of Alain Badiou and Julia Kristeva. The author argues that Baraitser avoids the more moralistic or naive versions of the contemporary ""return to the ethical"" and instead plots a powerfully original and iconoclastic philosophy of the maternal, which maintains an idiosyncratic subversive potential, both philosophically and politically.

Reading Baraitser with and through the work of the Northern Irish poet Medbh McGuckian, I interweave the aesthetic with the philosophical and psychoanalytical possibilities of taking ""maternity as the norm"" that Baraitser so suggestively explores (p. 10). McGuckian's poetry, I argue, answers Baraitser's question when she asks what kind of subjectivity emerges ""when we live in close proximity"" to a child and ""are somehow responsible for them, too"" (p. 11).

Baraitser's maternal encounter brings about a new approach to subjectivity within psychoanalytic discourse, reworking the relationship of this (maternal) position to the unsymbolisable and ambivalence, and reinscribes it as a privileged model for social, cultural, critical, and analytic encounters.

One of the main innovations of Baraitser's theory is its concurrent ability to ground futuristic force in such a way that enables an articulation of subjectivity in the midst of processes that work to unsettle fixed sureties. And this works two ways. Conjoining maternal subjectivity with futurity, Maternal Encounters has the important, indeed groundbreaking, effect of refiguring the mother, so often constructed as generator of the future, as a futuristic subject in her own right.

In this sample of bisexual men, the most commonly reported sexual behaviors were masturbation, vaginal intercourse and receiving oral sex from male and female partners. The majority of the participants were the insertive partner during anal sex with male partners. Many of the participants reported alcohol use during their most recent sexual activity. A fair number reported not using condoms during their last sexual event. Pleasure, arousal, orgasm and erectile functioning were markedly similar despite partner gender. A small number of participants also engaged in sexual activities with transgender individuals. All of the Latino participants took part in optional self-collection for STI specimens.

Many participants reported personal and social challenges associated with bisexuality, which in turn influenced their mental health. Reported instances of stigma toward bisexuality, from homosexual and heterosexual individuals, affected participants' feelings regarding their own sexualities. Isolation was also commonly reported.

Analysing government, industry and media discourses in relation to oral history interviews with thirty-eight women aircraft workers, we discuss women's distinctive role in shaping the health and morale of the social body during wartime, to ensure the maintenance of family, nation and the Allied war effort. While health in wartime was defined in terms of worker productivity for both men and women, anxiety about women's expanded roles heightened the emphasis on moral respectability as a marker of the 'healthy' female body. This was further complicated by the wartime emphasis on women's responsibilities to boost morale as part of their role in maintaining health and productivity for both men and women. Through such examples as workplace regulations and domestic advice, we examine the increased monitoring of women's individual and collective bodies and the intensified demands on female war workers as they crossed between the public and private spheres.

Such women appear frequently in Mughal writings and apparently played an important role in elite society; there is clearly much we can learn from such sources about gender and class in the empire generally, as well as female performers more specifically. However, what evidence we have is written from the perspective of their male patrons and cast according to long-standing rhetorical and cultural conventions concerning the fateful roles of music and love in historical events. In this article I examine how Mughal historical chronicles transform named female performers into stereotyped agents of the downfall of noblemen. Using the stories of several historical courtesans, I demonstrate how stock topoi of desire, enslavement, longing, rebellion, danger, fate and above all musical and erotic power, were used to shape all stories of courtesans into tragic cautionary tales.

Recent scholarship has increasingly considered women's participation in revolutions in order to understand women's roles in post-revolutionary societies. Looking beyond armed insurrection for instances of female participation in revolution, this article considers women's roles in the Cuban Literacy Campaign. An analysis of the testimonies of female former volunteer teachers and of the official rhetoric and content of the campaign suggests that the broader narrative of cooption, while certainly accurate overall, threatens to obscure instances in which women did challenge traditional gender norms in meaningful ways. This paper argues that the Cuban Literacy Campaign and the participation of women in that campaign significantly impacted Cuban patriarchal culture at a crucial moment of consolidation for the revolutionary regime. In other words, though the male-led revolution did not give women the space to organise against patriarchy, by actively participating in the revolution, women did help change the nature of Cuban patriarchy. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"educational development; gender issue; gender relations; governance approach; historical geography; literacy; political participation; social history; womens status; Cuba","Herman, R.; History Department, The University of California, Berkeley, United States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859068015

As a result, therapeutic treatments envisaged by medical practitioners were influenced by and related to the formulation of precepts of medical gymnastics. This article considers how 'physical education' for women became part of medical discourse, specifically the elaboration of 'body treatment' as a remedy against nervous disorders including hysteria. From the Second Republic (1848) to the years of the belle epoque (1914), the discourse concerning the medical cause of 'hysterical madness' is marked by the progressive discrediting of reflections that located the causes of pathology in the genitals. However, the shaping of a neuro-cerebral etiology did not fully replace discussions of the relationship between hysteria, female bodies and the uterus. While the current historiography emphasises the participation of doctors in the production and legitimation of physical exercises in the nineteenth century, some aspects of this process are not yet fully explored. We examine the ambivalences of medical discourse, between the rhetoric of the eternally wounded woman and the need to develop women's abilities (intellectual, moral, and physical) to ensure healthy children. And despite the shadows that still obscure the etiology of nervous disorders, there is, in our period, a genuine dynamic favouring experimental therapeutics. The 'movement disorders', such as chorea, hysteria or neurasthenia, were handled by increasingly well-established regimes utilising physical exercise. The introduction of gymnastics in the hospital played a fundamental role in this process; it enabled experimentation and lent legitimacy to physical exercise as therapy. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"historical perspective; mental health; nineteenth century; physical activity; womens health; France","Quin, G.; University of Lausanne (Switzerland)Switzerland",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859095242

However, post-war US domination in Okinawa has entailed far more complex dynamics involving gender and nation. This article examines domestic reformism that flourished in US-occupied Okinawa where a group of home economists and home demonstration agents dispatched from Michigan State University (MSU) played an instrumental role in disseminating 'scientific domesticity'. Following the land-grant philosophy of educational outreach and self-help, MSU home economists engaged in a series of domestic reform activities where they attempted to transplant notions and practices of 'scientific domesticity' and modernise and empower local women. Taking place amidst the intense militarisation of Okinawa under American rule, domestic reformism generated much excitement and enthusiasm among local women. By analysing how domesticity and militarism became intertwined in post-war Okinawa, the article explores the complex links between domesticity, international educational aid, militarism and the cold war in the Asia-Pacific region. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"Cold War; empowerment; feminism; gender issue; historical geography; modernity; political history; political relations; post-war; university sector; womens status; Japan; Okinawa [Ryukyu Islands]; Ryukyu Islands; United States","Koikari, M.; University of Hawai'i at ManoaUnited States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859059137

Because the qualities that made a good political friendship - loyalty, wise counsel and generosity, among others - corresponded so closely to the criteria for successful lordship, historians often used the quality of a king""s friendship as a signifier for the quality of his rule. Yet their treatment of women""s political friendship was markedly different. The discourse of friendship therefore provides a window into the larger struggle over the representation of gender and rulership in twelfth-century historical writing in England, reflecting chroniclers"" anxiety about female sovereignty. Twelfth-century historians depicted women""s participation in political friendship as acceptable only within certain circumscribed boundaries that corresponded to the sanctioned political roles for women in general. Otherwise, chroniclers attempted to efface the existence of women""s political friendship, sometimes describing the same situations in different language depending on whether the main participant was male or female. Chroniclers also represented women as arbiters of friendship, showing men how better to conduct their relationships either through direct instruction or counter-example. In both cases women reinforced male friendship, either by being excluded from it, or by demonstrating the correct way to carry it out. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"gender issue; historical geography; historical perspective; language; political history; social history; sovereignty; womens status; England; United Kingdom","Slitt, R.; Queens University in Kingston, ON, Canada",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859088939

More so than other pairs of friends, heterosocial friends had to attend to how their friendships appeared to those around them. One of the most important ways of doing so was positioning a friendship in relation to spouses. In an era when marriage was the central structure for relations between men and women and fears of seduction and ruin were rampant, friends of the opposite sex needed to integrate their friendships within their marriages. This paper examines how men and women did so through the lens of their correspondence. Navigating a society without clear boundaries or rules for conducting a friendship between a man and a woman, individual pairs of friends improvised to create safe friendships in person and in letters. The careful intertwining of marriages and friendships they created demonstrates the way intimate social relationships were embedded in the social fabric of the early American republic. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"gender issue; gender relations; historical geography; historical perspective; marriage; social history; United States","Good, C.A.; University of PennsylvaniaUnited States",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859031890

This article, largely based on oral history interviews with former deserters, analyses the gendered identities of Austrian men who were recruited to serve in the Wehrmacht and who later deserted. Deserters were brutally persecuted in the Third Reich and denounced as 'traitors' and 'cowards'. The glorification of martial masculinity in Nazi Germany played a crucial role in the defamation of deserters, whose manliness was called into question. Based on Connell's theory of hegemonic masculinity, the article aims to establish the actual influence of dominant ideals of masculinity. It investigates how these deserters perceived themselves as men and how they negotiated their gendered identities in interaction with their surroundings. The analysis reveals the considerable influence of the hegemonic ideal of 'hard' masculinity, which was far greater than the impact of the rather short-lived ideal of martial masculinity. But it also demonstrates the contradictory nature of gendered identities and gives valuable insights into the selective appropriation of masculine values. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"gender identity; gender issue; gender relations; hegemony; nineteenth century; perception; political history; twentieth century; war; Austria","Fritsche, M.; Norwegian University of Science and Technology in TrondheimNorway",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859082801

Scholars have focused largely on the way in which Properzia's description aligns with derogatory assumptions about female nature in early modern Italy. While this is a defining characteristic of Properzia's vita, my paper explores alternative and potentially positive aspects of the text, by considering Vasari's attempts to integrate Properzia into the broader enterprise of the Lives and, more generally, art historical discourse of the time. I will argue that Vasari's approach invites a polemical response connected to these wider issues by setting up a paradoxical relationship between Properzia's archetypal female body and the manual movement required of it to sculpt. In contrasting notions of the feminine and the masculine, the noble body and the ignoble body, the intellectual and the manual, Properzia's vita can be connected specifically to the paragone (comparison) between painting and sculpture and also to questions relating to the status of the artist. In such a way the female artist is seen to take on an emblematic and instructive role within the text. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..",,"art; female; Middle Ages; Italy","Quin, S.; Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Visual Arts, University of Western AustraliaAustralia",,,09535233,,,,"English","Gender and Hist.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859115160

This hypothesis was in keeping with the findings of a recent meta-analysis which indicated such a positive association between porn use and attitudes. However, in this meta-analysis there was also a high degree of heterogeneity among studies, suggesting the existence of crucial moderating variables. Unfortunately, the available literature included in this meta-analysis did not enable identifying the basis for such moderation. To fully test our hypothesis of individual differences moderation and related hypotheses requires a representative sample. Fortunately, a unique nationally representative sample of U. S. men in any form of post-high school education that we obtained in 1984-85 enabled testing our predictions. Participants had anonymously completed questionnaires that included items pertaining to pornography use, attitudes about violence against women, and other measures assessing risk factors highlighted by the Confluence Model. As predicted, while we found an overall positive association between pornography consumption and attitudes, further examination showed that it was moderated by individual differences. More specifically, as predicted this association was found to be largely due to men at relatively high risk for sexually aggression who were relatively frequent pornography consumers. The findings help resolve inconsistencies in the literature and are in line not only with experimental research on attitudes but also with both experimental and non-experimental studies assessing the relationship between pornography consumption and sexually aggressive behavior. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Attitudes supporting violence; Confluence Model; Pornography; Rape myths",,"Malamuth, N.

Mothers provided reports of their gender-role attitudes and rated their expectancies and emotional/behavioral reactions following hypothetical vignettes depicting their child displaying physically aggressive and shy-withdrawn behaviors. It was hypothesized that mothers would respond with more negative (and less positive) emotions and expectancies in response to children's gender-incongruent problem behaviors (i. e., shyness among boys, aggression among girls). It was further hypothesized that these gender effects would be more pronounced among mothers espousing more traditional (i. e., less egalitarian) gender-role attitudes. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that mothers anticipated more negative consequences to aggression among boys than among girls. Several significant interaction effects also emerged between child gender and maternal gender-role attitudes, particularly with regards to children's shyness. Among mothers of boys, a more egalitarian gender-role attitude was associated with greater anticipated benefits of shyness, and both more positive and more negative emotional responses to shyness. For mothers of girls, however, the opposite pattern emerged. Results provide some support for the notion that mothers may enforce gender-typical social behaviors in their children, particularly if they themselves hold more traditional gender-role attitudes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender roles; Parenting; Social development; Socialization",,"Kingsbury, M.

S., college students. Participants evaluated violations of friendship norms described in vignettes in which the friend's gender was experimentally manipulated. Women differentiated more between types of violations in their evaluations than did men. There also were several significant gender differences in approval of norm violations. As expected, women tended to have relatively high expectations of their friendships in situations involving trust and intimacy, likely resulting from the high value they placed on affiliation and emotional closeness. Women were more disapproving than men of a friend who canceled plans or failed to come to their defense publicly. Men and women judged a woman who betrayed a secret more harshly than a man. Generally, expectations for cross-gender, versus same-gender, friends were more similar than different; there were no significant cross-gender interactions, with one exception. Men were particularly less approving of a male, as compared to a female, friend who kissed them in a greeting. Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of respondents (81. 6%) reported that men and women can be friends. A minority of women were cautious in their responses, with women (18. 5%) more apt to reply ""maybe,"" than men (9. 9%). Overall, these findings provided evidence that gender, rather than cross-gender, norms primarily influenced friendship evaluations, and demonstrated that even a subtle manipulation of gender can trigger gender stereotypes. They suggested, too, that women may hold their friends to stricter ""rules"" than men. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cross-gender friendship; Friendship; Friendship expectations; Gender differences; Norms",,"Felmlee, D.; Department of Sociology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, United States; email: dhfelmlee@ucdavis.edu",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858337131

Based on empirical literature applying Ambivalent Sexism Theory, and in the light of the socio-political context, it was hypothesized that: (1) both hostile and benevolent attitudes toward men in Poland would be more liberal than in South Africa and more conservative than in the United Kingdom, and (2), women would exhibit more hostile but less benevolent attitudes than men in relatively more conservative South Africa. The Ambivalence to Men Inventory was used to measure the two types of sexist attitudes about men. Findings supported the first hypothesis for hostile attitudes and partially for benevolent attitudes. South African and Polish students were more benevolent and hostile to men than British students, and students from South Africa were more hostile than those from Poland. Moreover, as predicted, a significant country-by-gender interaction revealed that South African women had more hostile and less benevolent attitudes to men than South African men.

Specifically, in two experiments, men and women received patronizing behavior (i. e., praise paired with a devalued position that did not provide an opportunity for monetary rewards) from a male leader in a stereotypically masculine domain. In this context, we manipulated contextual control cues and measured math performance. In Experiment 1, 113 undergraduates (60 women, 53 men) from a Midwestern University in the United States received the patronizing behavior and all position assignments were made either at the outset (no control) or multiple times (ambiguous control) from one patronizing leader. In Experiment 2, 132 undergraduates (53 women, 79 men) from a U. S. Midwestern University received patronizing behavior and position assignments were made by one leader (ambiguous control) or multiple leaders (enhanced control). Consistent with Hypothesis 1, women had lower performance expectations than men, but no reliable gender differences emerged for desire to succeed. Consistent with Hypothesis 2, gender differences in math performance only emerged in the ambiguous control conditions in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 with men performing better than women. Finally, consistent with Hypothesis 3, women performed better in the enhanced control (vs. ambiguous control), despite receiving patronizing behavior.

Much of the previous work that has utilized this framework has examined highly (male-) gendered organizations. This archival case study aims to use Acker's framework to examine a purportedly female-gendered organization - the 1970s feminist organization, Stewardesses for Women's Rights (SFWR). Design/methodology/ approach - Using these archived materials, this paper uses a critical hermeneutic approach across Acker's framework of gendered organization to make sense of the rise and fall of SFWR. The paper discusses lessons learned from this short-lived organization. Findings - The paper finds that societal pressure and organizing women's understanding of what is ""real"" and valued in an organization pushed them to create an organization that was as highly (male) gendered as the organizations from which they were escaping. Many in the organization never saw SFWR as a ""real"" organization because of the underlying organizational logic that was directing what the organization should be. Even if the organization did, on the surface, look different than other explicitly male-gendered organizations, the same underlying organizational logic manifested itself in similar organizational structure. Originality/value - This archival case study uses Acker's framework to examine a purportedly female-gendered organization - the 1970s feminist organization SFWR and reveals lessons learned.

Within the existing breadth and depth of feminist organizational scholarship an increasing number of researchers have been drawn to Joan Acker's notion of the ""gendered substructure"" as one of the more promising frameworks for analysis of the gendering of organizations. In this paper the authors seek to develop an analysis of Acker's gendered substructure through, and reflection on, its application. Design/methodology/approach - Acker's framework of gendering processes is explored through a case study of the gendering of a single organization over time - Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). The authors' ""reading"" of the archival materials was informed by a combination of feminist poststructuralism, critical discourse analysis and critical hermeneutics. Findings - Through an exploration of the roots of Acker's framework and its application to a case study of a single organization over time (Pan Am), the paper contends that its greatest potential lies in examining the four process sets - division of labor, workplace culture, social interactions and (self) reflection - through a fifth process of ""organizational logic"" that is seen as temporal and contextual. Drawing on poststructuralist feminist theory, it argues that organizational logic can be viewed through analyses of organizational, and organizationally based, discourses. Originality/value - The paper argues that the (widely recognized) heuristic value of Joan Acker's ""gendered substructure"" has not been realized due to inconsistencies in its interpretation and application. This study engages Acker's framework in its entirety, as gendering processes do not exist in silos and are likely more interdependent than typically credited. The paper looks at the dynamics of, and between the five sets of, gendering processes. Copyright © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The qualitative analysis employed in this paper is based upon empirical findings from field work conducted in the state of Penang on the north-western coast of Peninsular Malaysia. In total, 39 hawkers (petty traders) were interviewed using an interview guide which contained open-ended questions regarding work-life history, labor market choices and conditions of work. The paper presents two selected case stories, as well as the general findings across the whole sample. In contrast to the view that women's informal micro-entrepreneurship is motivated only by “involuntary exclusion from the labor market” or “poverty”, this paper has found that women's micro-entrepreneurship can be motivated by a wide range of factors including: to earn an income; interest in doing business; increased flexibility and autonomy; possibility to combine with family obligations; and re-negotiating spatial practices. Conclusive with previous studies it also argues that necessity and choice may be “co-present” in the motives to enter into entrepreneurship. The limited sample of this study has implications for the generalizability of results. Further studies into the women's micro-entrepreneurial activities in Malaysia are therefore encouraged. Women's micro-entrepreneurship is increasingly being promoted as a way to create growth and development (particularly through micro-credit schemes). Increasing knowledge around motivational factors, performance and conditions of work for women informal micro-entrepreneurs is therefore important when trying to establish appropriate policies. There are very few studies in the Malaysian context which focus upon women's informal micro-entrepreneurship in general and hawking in particular. This study therefore presents new knowledge around women's informal micro-entrepreneurship in Malaysia. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Informal economy; Malaysia; Micro businesses; Microeconomics; Women; Women's entrepreneurship",,"Franck, A.K.; Department of Human and Economic Geography, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

The authors' hypotheses were tested using data gathered from members of Women Impacting Public Policy (WIPP), a national (US) public policy organization that advocates for women in business. Results indicate that top management team gender composition and entrepreneurial orientation are significantly related to international diversification but that ownership gender composition is not. The authors found that team entrepreneurial orientation may be useful when teams are more homogeneous on relations-oriented characteristics such as gender. The paper's findings suggest that women-only management teams high in entrepreneurial orientation are more likely to pursue international diversification, dispelling the idea that international diversification is more difficult for women. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurs; International business; Small to medium-sized enterprises; United States of America; Women; Women entrepreneurs",,,,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

The authors' research purpose called for an inductive approach. Interviews with a sample of women technology entrepreneurs allowed for in-depth exploration of their subjective experiences and the contexts in which these were situated. The research subjects encountered persistent gender stereotypes, a paucity of female role models, resistance from associates within and outside of their organizations, and societal pressures to maintain appropriate levels of work-family balance. Although exploratory and preliminary in nature, the findings indicate that women entrepreneurs do not experience “glass ceilings” as much as they experience “labyrinth walls” and what the authors identify as “thorny floors”, meaning opposition and sabotage from male subordinates. Women considering entrepreneurship should expect to encounter resistance to their leadership, albeit manifested in different forms than in corporate settings. Male-dominated fields such as technology involve industry-level resistance as well as opposition from within the organization. Nevertheless, women perceived the field as merit-driven whereby they gained acceptance once they had established themselves as credible competitors.

From an analytical gender perspective based on a combination of Mayoux's framework of paradigms in support of women's entrepreneurship, Rees' approach to gender equality and Bacchi's analysis of what the problem is represented to be, the author performs a systematic comparative analysis of the varying policy goals, underlying paradigms and approaches in state support programmes for women's entrepreneurship in the Nordic countries. The author concludes that all Nordic countries, with the exception of Iceland, have a programme or an action plan to support women's entrepreneurship, but vary in their underlying paradigms and rationales. The author places Norway at one end of the spectrum because its policy programme is most clearly influenced by a feminist empowerment paradigm intended to transform and/or tailor the existing support system through various measures. At the other end of the spectrum is Denmark, which most clearly focuses on economic growth in line with a neo-liberal paradigm. Between these extremes, are Sweden, Finland and Iceland. The analysis reveals that state support programmes, in the name of supporting women entrepreneurs, tend to put women in a subordinate position to men and thereby risk sustaining a male norm. The paper contributes a much-needed systematic comparative analysis of support for women's entrepreneurship in the Nordic countries. This analysis is important in order to further the discussion of how policy actors can refrain from putting women in a secondary position to men, and thus avoid sustaining a male norm in entrepreneurship support. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurialism; Entrepreneurship; Gender; Government policy; Nordic countries; Policy support; Women; Women's entrepreneurship",,"Pettersson, K.; Nordregio (Nordic Centre for Spatial Development), Stockholm, Sweden",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

The paper addresses both single entrepreneurs as well as entrepreneurial teams regarding gender. The paper examines firm characteristics and firm success variables in light of gender. Data were sourced from 593 firms in very-high-tech-manufacturing, 886 firms in high-tech manufacturing, and 4.822 firms in technology-based service industries. Results confirm the supposed gender gap in the technology industry. Whereas firm characteristics such as firm size, number of employees, and revenues are correlated to gender, firm success appears to be independent of these. This paper focuses on the analysis of firm characteristics and gender variables. Due to the data sample, it contributes to the understanding of gender, as well as firm success and characteristics of German technology-based firms. The quantitative nature of this study contributes to reducing the scarcity of existing studies in the field of women entrepreneurship in technology-based industries in Germany. It offers insights into the gender and entrepreneurial team characteristics of these firms. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Entrepreneurial teams; Entrepreneurs; Gender; Germany; Interpersonal relations; Success; Technology-based firms",,"Dautzenberg, K.; University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany",,,17566266,,,,"English","Int.

A 34item version of the CPS was completed by 243 women from all levels of management, mostly in Australia. An expanded 38item CPS was administered to another sample of women (n=307). Analyses of data from both studies yielded a four factor model of attitudes to glass ceilings: resilience, acceptance, resignation and denial. The factors demonstrated good internal consistency. The CPS allows a comparison of positive attitudes towards seeking promotions via resilience and denial scores, and provides feedback on negative attitudes towards seeking promotions via resignation and acceptance scores. This new measure can be recommended for studies of women's and men's attitudes towards gender inequality in organizational leadership. Also, it could play a role in identifying sexist cultures in organizations. Because of the scarcity of measures of glass ceiling beliefs, this study makes a major contribution to the literature on women's beliefs about barriers to career advancement. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Acceptance; Attitude surveys; Australia; Career development; Denial; Glass ceilings; Measures; Resignation; Resilience; Women; Women's beliefs",,,,,17542413,,,,"English","Gender Manage.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863411251

E. B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies. Arguably, most salient in this legacy are four lessons and achievements. The first lesson included the resistance, resiliency, and resourcefulness of the principal graduate co-founders of the department, Michael Thelwell and Bernard Bell, in seeking to manage threatening conflicts to radical yet peaceful reforms in education and in validating non-traditional students, faculty, and curricula. The second was our uneven and, ultimately, moderately successful efforts to emulate and unite synergistically Du Bois' standards of political activism and scholarly excellence while valorizing the recruitment and retention of high-risk students and a few uniquely qualified non-credentialed scholar/activist faculty. And the third and fourth achievements were the agency of the Black Student Movement in founding, respectively, the most unique department and consortium of five Black Studies departments in the nation. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Afro-American studies; Black studies; Radical legacy",,"Bell, B.

Participants were recruited on a public beach during their Spring Break vacation and were administered a survey that included the TWEAK, a brief screener to identify alcohol use disorder (AUD) risk. Initial results indicated that heavy alcohol use, riding with an alcohol-impaired driver, and marijuana use were high during T 1 and increased significantly during T 2 . The TWEAK results indicated that 78% of respondents were at high AUD risk, yet only 25% felt the need to reduce their alcohol consumption. OLS regression results indicated significant relationships between changes in engagement in risk behaviors at T 2 as compared to T 1 across a number of sample characteristics and TWEAK indicators (e.g., age at first drink; age at first sex).

Without this attribution, logic mandates that such organizations find more evidence-based justifications for teen pregnancy prevention that still address the lived experiences of populations most at risk for early parenthood. If such evidence-based justifications continue to be lacking, it is unlikely that these well-intentioned efforts will truly have a beneficial impact on the communities with which they are concerned. This paper presents such justifications, including recognition of the challenges inherent in parenting and protection of adolescence as a developmental stage, the need to make pregnancy prevention more accessible for those who chose it, and overall investment in adolescent sexual health. From this new paradigm, sexual health advocates can build a class-conscious model of sexual health that recognizes the necessity of providing more options for at-risk youth, the appeal of models of conjoint agency, and the necessity of comprehensive health resources and sexuality education.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the sexual consequences of FGM/C. A total of 15 studies, of variable methodological quality, with 12,671 participants from seven different countries were included. The majority of the 65 outcomes were statistically associated with FGM/ C status at study level. Meta-analysis results showed that compared to women without FGM/C, women who had been subjected to FGM/C were more likely to report dyspareunia (relative risk (RR)=1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.15, 2.0), no sexual desire (RR=2.15, 95% CI=1.37, 3.36) and less sexual satisfaction (standardized mean difference=-0.34, 95% CI=-0.56, -0.13). Heterogeneity precluded additional consideration of other outcomes. The systematic review substantiates the proposition that a woman whose genital tissues have been partly removed is more likely to experience increased pain and reduction in sexual satisfaction and desire.

In this mixed-methods study, sexual minority women (N = 64) who were currently trying to conceive, pregnant, or parenting an infant completed standardized questionnaires to assess mental health, social support, and other variables. Fourteen participants identified as bisexual, and 14 reported sexual activity with men in the past 5 years (there was incomplete overlap between these groups). Twenty women (5 bisexual-identified) also completed a qualitative interview. Bisexual women reported poorer scores on assessments of mental health, substance use, social support, and experiences of perceived discrimination, relative to other women in the sample. Differences were particularly pronounced for women who reported sexual activity with men in the past 5 years compared to women who did not. Qualitative analyses highlighted experiences of invisibility and exclusion. It may be particularly challenging for bisexual women to negotiate the invisibility associated with a bisexual identity during the perinatal period, as a result of the implicit assumption that mothers are heterosexual.

It draws on data collected as part of a cross-national comparative study on the employment of migrant care workers in residential care homes and home care services for older people in England and Ireland. The article examines, first, the ways in which divisions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship shape the preferences of service providers/employers and some service users as regards who provides care. Second, it examines how the institutional context of quasi-markets in long-term care shapes the negotiation of demand for migrant labor, the racialized preferences of individual users, alongside the rights of care workers to non-discrimination. It is argued that market-oriented policies for personalization, as well as for cost containment, raise implications for divisions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship in the provision of long-term care. At the same time, those divisions point to the limits of framing care in terms of the preferences of the individual as opposed to the social relations in which care is embedded. © 2012 The Author Published by Oxford University Press.

This article argues that we could achieve a better understanding of the different modalities and trajectories of care in the reproduction of individuals, families, and communities, both of migrant and nonmigrant populations by articulating the diverse circuits of migration, in particular that of labor and the family. In doing this, I go back to the earlier North American writing on racialized minorities and migrants and stratified social reproduction. I also explore insights from current Asian studies of gendered circuits of migration connecting labor and marriage migrations as well as the notion of global householding that highlights the gender politics of social reproduction operating within and beyond households in institutional and welfare architectures. In contrast to Asia, there has relatively been little exploration in European studies of the articulation of labor and family migrations through the lens of social reproduction. However, connecting the different types of migration enables us to achieve a more complex understanding of care trajectories and their contribution to social reproduction. © 2012 The Author Published by Oxford University Press.

On the basis of empirical research and interviews with Latvian nurses and families they left behind, this article argues that nurse migration transforms families and communities and that national health services now become global workplaces. Some decades ago feminist research pointed to the fact that the welfare state was based on a male breadwinner family and women's unpaid production of care work at home. Today this production of unpaid care is ""outsourced"" from richer to poorer countries and is related to an emergence of transnational spaces of care.

Drawing on a case of Bulgarian Muslim migrants in Spain, I look into the ruptures in the structure of care arrangements, kin expectations, and family relations, which migration triggers. I suggest that these transformations, albeit subtle, lead to reformulation of the fabric of the family. In this way, transnational care-motivated mobility affects future security based on kin reciprocity. At the same time, migration disrupts aging carers' social citizenship both in Bulgaria and in Spain by limiting or even excluding them from state welfare support. I argue that these two lines of transformation, kinship and citizenship, result in new forms of gender and intergenerational inequalities. Furthermore, their intersection leads to a move from welfare to kinfare, which not only affects present arrangements between migrants, but also entails future insecurities. © 2012 The Author Published by Oxford University Press.

Specifically, in 1835, P.T. Barnum fraudulently staged Heth as George Washington's 161-year-old nursemaid in New York (and elsewhere) until her death in 1836. I discuss these elusive somatic acts through, first, the careful scripting of Heth within freak-show dramaturgy and a uniquely fictionalized national past. I argue that through Heth's mythic impersonation as a black female surrogate for a collective American memory, we come to see how the latter was as much a tenuous and rehearsed fiction as her corporeal stagings. In the second half of this article, I approach the quagmire of Heth's free will vis-à-vis her brute objectification through the emergence in the archive of her vocal resistance, a disruptive sound I call a sonic of dissent. Ultimately, the spectral traces of Joice Heth's performances as an ancient negress intimate the longing for a black maternal national memory. © 2012 Women & Performance Project Inc..","America; black performance; freak show; Joice Heth; mammy; myth; sonic dissent",,"McMillan, U.; Department of English, University of California, Los Angeles, United States; email: umcmillan@ucla.edu",,,0740770X,,,,"English","Women Perform.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866091245

At its heart are a number of stand-up performances made since 2000 by Phyllis Diller, Joan Rivers and Roseanne Barr, informed and supported by their performances in a variety of other forms and media (including reality television, talk shows and auto/biographical writing). These performances draw attention to the relationship between performative utterance and visuality through the tropes of public confession and allusions to cosmetic surgery and aging genitalia. This can be risky in a genre in which staged persona, body and performance material are so closely yoked. Despite their different ages and signature practices, Diller, Rivers and Barr can be seen to be working in a professional lineage of female comedians, including Sophie Tucker, Jackie Moms Mabley, Belle Barth, Pearl Williams and LaWanda Page, who have foregrounded their own sexuality as aging women. In their redeployment of taboos which mark the female body as grotesque and unruly, these women expose the scopic regimes that limit how post-menopausal women are read, and thereby erased, in the public realm. © 2012 Women & Performance Project Inc..","aging; comedy; cosmetic surgery; performance; sexuality",,"Mock, R.; University of PlymouthUnited Kingdom; email: R.Mock@plymouth.ac.uk",,,0740770X,,,,"English","Women Perform.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866066173

The essay develops the transformative ethical possibilities of and queer political potentialities of pyrography by reading Guibert's project with his two elderly aunts in relation to the work of two of Guibert's intimates: Michel Foucault's The Social Triumph of the Sexual Will and Roland Barthes's Camera Lucida and Mourning Diary. In Mourning Diary, Barthes describes the plan for Camera Lucida as an ephemeral monument to his dead mother whose loss he calls, following the last work of psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott: the catastrophe that has already occurred. Through its own writing with fire of the death we fear that has already occurred and that we cannot access directly, photography may enable the kind of as if work or projective imaginative enactment for which Winnicott calls. This essay put this concept of the photographic pyre or pyrographies to work to characterize a kind of photographic act. Pyrography is a facture of and with the flammable, not of and about the past, but for the present and future. It is a practice of making volatile structures for feeling with the taboo scenes of the conjunction of old age, desire, and death that create spaces not just for mourning the losses that have actually happened. Pyrographies shape spaces in which one might begin to imagine and transact with care the losses and the letting go yet to come. Pyrographies, I am suggesting, trade in the illusions of presence. They give us the catastrophe that has already occurred in palpable form, enabling us to negotiate shame and fear but also desire toward the seemingly impossible: the good death. © 2012 Women & Performance Project Inc..","care for death; good death; photographic ecstasy; photography; punctum; queer; shame",,"Casid, J.H.; Department of Art History, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, United States; email: jhcasid@wisc.edu",,,0740770X,,,,"English","Women Perform.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866131891

Producer organisations' experience suggests that there is great need for gender equality issues to be integrated into all stages of coffee production and marketing - referred to as 'value chains' - if women are to realise prosperity from their labour, and to move up the value chain as active participants and decision-makers. Producer organisations need to develop strategies for addressing gender-specific constraints, and to build women's capabilities and confidence to aspire to positions and influence across the whole value chain. They should also seek to dismantle gender discrimination in the design, implementation, and monitoring of the wider certification code in coffee value chains. © 2012 Copyright Oxfam GB.","gender and value chains; gender equality; global certification; producer groups; women's position",,"Kasente, D.; Makerere University, P.O.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors assess gender differences in the odds of being promoted to senior management by: analyzing the relative impact of individual, organizational and family level variables in accounting for gender inequity; examining gender differences in experiences of perceived gender discrimination and sexual harassment, as well as attitudes regarding gender equity in senior management; and by exploring gender differences in aspirations for senior management. ANOVA, χ 2 and logistic regression were used to analyze data from 685 respondents to the 2006 Gender and Careers in Healthcare Management Survey. Findings: Women were significantly less likely to be promoted to senior management, even after controlling for individual, organizational and family level characteristics. One third of women healthcare managers in our study reported perceived gender discrimination in the past five years. Less than half of male healthcare managers were supportive of increasing the proportion of women in senior management positions, while over 80 percent of women were. Among those not yet promoted women were significantly less likely than their male peers to aspire to senior management positions.

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses surveys that utilize the Schein descriptive index and the women as managers scale (WAMS) to compare perceptions on women in managerial positions in Egypt and the USA. The sample consists of 553 Egyptian and 324 American management students. Findings: The results show that in the Egyptian sample both males and females held negative views of women managers. However, in the US sample, women held more favourable views of women managers than did their male counterparts. In the Egyptian sample the English section female students had a more positive perception of female managers than their Arabic section counterparts. Research limitations/implications: The sample is limited to management students in Egypt and the USA. The Middle East includes countries with different cultures, such as Israel. About 10 percent of Egypt's population are Christians who do not necessarily share the same cultural beliefs as the country's Muslim majority. Practical implications: The paper helps donor countries better direct their aid programs when it comes to promoting gender equality and championing women's rights in the Middle East.

Study results are based on a 2009-2010 large-scale national probability survey of young adults aged 18-24 in Croatia (n = 1,005) and Norway (n = 871). A majority of sexually active young adults in Croatia and Norway assessed the risk of becoming infected with HIV or other STIs as low or negligible. Among non-condom users, 85-98% determined they had low or no risk of getting infected with HIV. The corresponding figures for STIs were 77-79%. In both countries a higher HIV risk self-assessment was observed among those who had had same-sex sexual experience, those who reported a higher number of sex partners during the past year, and those who were single. When investigating the patterns of HIV/STI risk assessment, gender and country-related differences appeared. Condom use associated with higher risk assessment was significant only among Croatian men. The strong perception of condom use as being a male responsibility in Croatia may be the reason for a higher risk assessment for unwanted pregnancy and HIV/STIs when protection fails. The risk assessment for HIV/STIs was not associated with partner turnover in Croatian men. New campaigns need to develop gender-sensitive messages, particularly targeting men who believe that a great number of sexual partners is a sign of manliness and women who shy away from their responsibility to use protection. © 2011 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.","Condoms; Croatia; HIV; Norway; Risk assessment; Sexuality; STI; Young adults",,"Træen, B.; Department of Psychology, University of Tromsø, NO-9037, Tromsø, Norway; email: bente.treen@uit.no",,,10955143,,,,"English","Sex.

Drawing on intersectional theory, I problematise the multiplicative character of their location in order to be able to understand how intersectional agency operates. This location reveals three layers of intersectionality; the junction of axes of social signification (gender and race); the junction of manifestations on these axes (female and white); and the junction of, subsequent, positions in power relations (disadvantaged and advantaged). I argue that this is specifically important and complex when we explore how whiteness can operate intersectionally. This results in three observations. First, this intersectional junction is conflictive in its interior; race as advantage and gender as disadvantage can operate as opposite structuring forces in power relations. Second, feminist activism is characterised by gendered action and aims at social transformation in the realm of gender. Whiteness, on the other hand, is often marked by racial passivity and omission via which it can invest in the maintenance of the racial status quo and non-change; this contradicts feminist objectives. Third, contra the conflation of agency with action, I agree that not every action is agentic. If not every action is agentic, then not all agency generates action. In turn, this means that agency can also result in omission; 'something' which is not action, i.e. an absence or void of action or, what I call, inaction. We can say that inaction is a familiar manifestation of hegemonic processes as whiteness. In turn, we can see that gender and race as structuring forces, subsequently, shape agency contradictorily, which can generate action and inaction simultaneously. The differentiation of layers in intersectional theory suggests that the agency of white, feminist activists is mobilised within a conceptual opposition in power relations that, consequently, questions the 'wholeness' of intersectional agency.","Agency; Intersectional theory; White women",,"Huijg, D.D.; University of ManchesterUnited Kingdom; email: Dieuwertje.Huijg@manchester.ac.uk",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Clandestine or survival sex is practiced when women are facing an economic dilemma. These women are non-literate and have no job skills. Further, they do not see themselves as sex workers because they only ""go out"" (colloquial for prostituting) occasionally. In light of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is important to reach these women as they are exposed to HIV infection and violence. Based on literary research, observations, focus groups and interviews with the personnel working with registered and clandestine sex workers in Senegal in 2009, my paper discusses clandestine prostitution and its impact on HIV/AIDS prevention. Interventions efforts should link HIV/AIDS prevention programs for sex workers to NGOs' grassroots projects offering adult literacy classes, skill training and microfinance.","Clandestine prostitution; Microfinance; Women's literacy",,"Tucker, G.M.; UCLA Center for the Study of WomenUnited States; email: gmaytuck@aol.com",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Intersectionality is the systematic study of the ways in which differences such as race, gender, sexuality, class, ethnicity and other sociopolitical and cultural identities interrelate. Queer theory, when applied as a distinct methodological approach to the study of gender and sexuality, has sought to denaturalise categories of analysis and make normativity visible. By examining existing research projects framed as 'queer' alongside ones that use intersectionality, I consider the importance of positionality in research accounts. I revisit Judith Halberstam's (1998) 'Female Masculinity' and Gloria Anzaldua's (1987) 'Borderlands' and discuss the tension between the act of naming and the critical strategical adoption of categorical thinking. Finally, I suggest hybridity as one possible complementary methodological approach to those of intersectionality and queer studies. Hybridity can facilitate an understanding of shifting textual and material borders and can operate as a creative and political mode of destabilising not only complex social locations, but also research frameworks.","Hybridity; Intersectionality; Queer studies",,"Fotopoulou, A.email: A.Fotopoulou@sussex.ac.uk",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

Using qualitative methods the study sought to identify the impact of violence on mental health as well as develop a greater understanding of the roles of resilience, coping and identity. Women from Somalia and Zimbabwe who attended a refugee centre in the UK were interviewed; analysis of the results identified a relationship between resilience, access to rights and support and identity. It also recognised cultural and societal influences and experiences in the United Kingdom as contributing factors. Findings support the move toward a more holistic model of understanding refugee women's experiences.

The rich scholarship on fear of crime has exclusively dealt with fear of crime on the streets, ignoring the threat of crime within private spaces. The study conducted in Kolkata, capital of West Bengal, India, demonstrates that for women there is a sexualization of risk whereby women participants express their overwhelming fear of sexual harm in public spaces and deny any kind of fear of crime in private spaces. The article argues that women recast the meanings of danger and risk in their public and private lives when they express their fear of crime in intimate relations. I argue that the acknowledgement and naming of the harm women encounter in intimate relations make women reconstruct the notions and perceptions of risk in intimate relations as they realize that their intimates are dangerous and the life with them is risky. Other women participants experiencing harm in intimate relations do not define them as serious, as they are affected by dominant stereotypes.

I suggest that gendered behaviours are not fixed and, just as they are learned in the first place, they can also be unlearned and replaced by new ones. Using the example of women's self-defense, the essay investigates how women can train their bodies to both cause and endure pain and, through this, challenge the traditional feminine corporeal habitus.

Sierra Leonean women are today among the most marginalized in the world, socially, economically and politically. However, there are differences among three groups: the better educated, comparatively richer ?Krios"" (descendants of the original freed slaves); relatively enlightened tribes; and the more traditional patriarchal tribes. The main route to improving the status of Sierra Leonean women is political empowerment. Some progress has been made since the civil war, post-conflict reconstruction programs and donor pressure are also opening up new opportunities for women progress, and there are hopes of significant electoral gains for women in the 2012 elections, inspired by the promising developments in neighboring post-conflict Liberia (which in 2005 elected Africa's first female president). However, sustainable advancement depends on alliances whereby the better-educated urban women exert pressure for solving concrete problems of poorer women in exchange for their political support. Although such alliances are difficult, new grassroots women organizations have achieved positive initial results, which can be consolidated and expanded by appropriate partnership with international women NGOs.","African women; Gender and development; Post-conflict reconstruction",,"McFerson, H.M.; George Mason UniversityUnited States",,,15398706,,,,"English","J.

It was found that a considerable implementation gap emerged as a major obstacle to teachers' implementation of the New Curriculum requirements in their classroom practices due to a series of contextual constraints, namely teacher intransigence, examination imperatives, learner reluctance and pedagogy/policy inconsistencies. The study suggests the necessity to address the gap between reform ideas at the macro level and the school realities at the micro level throughout the implementation process, particularly at the initial stage.

The research is part of a larger project focusing on discourses on Intelligence in Swedish upper secondary school, and how these are produced and used in different educational contexts. The title of the article quotes Emily, a hardworking and high-achieving TP student. Emily is disappointed that the academic courses much of the time operate on a rote level, and that teachers' expectations on the students in the programme generally are quite low. The present study also indicates, in line with several studies of vocational education in Sweden, that academic courses in vocational programmes often seem to provide scarce opportunity for theoretical learning and higher order thinking. Others suggest that the vocational courses present better conditions for such learning. The present article explores learning and instruction in different subjects and the conditions that are structuring them. It discusses the possibility that performativity pressure is one of the structuring forces. 'Performativity' is used here to refer to the notion that individuals and systems are valued based on their measured performances in regard to standards, and identified by those standards. Thus ascribed values become ends in themselves and render the use value of knowledge subordinate to the exchange value. This means that not only knowledge but also the pedagogical interaction and relationships become commodified. This is exactly what happens when new managerialism and economic rationality are imposed on the education system, as it has been throughout the Western world in the last decades. Swedish educational policy has gone far down this road, focusing measurable outcomes, individual choice and competition on all levels as means for quality.

As such, their contribution to human practices often remains unnoticed in the background of routine activities. In order to make the materiality of practice available to ethnographic observation, we thus have to analytically disassemble these assemblages.

Building on existing research on women and work in the UK and in Russia, we seek to provide new insights into Russian women's own understandings of work and non-work choices grounded in an analysis of women's use of rights discourses. Drawing on in-depth interview data with 49 women living in the provincial Russian city of Ul'ianovsk, we explore constructions of work in relation to narratives of discrimination; as a means of 'samorealizatsiia', and as 'choice' reflecting the continuing inseparability of public and private roles for women.

This article presents case-based evidence on the work orientations, gender relations and reconciliation strategies of low-educated women working in the clothing industry in Portugal. The analysis reveals that while economic need plays an important role in their attachment to employment, their work decisions are forged by a complex set of attitudes regarding employment and the family. Traditional values regarding the role of women in the family co-exist with more modern values regarding their employment participation. Moreover, the institutional arrangements of childcare and reconciliation also appear to be more supportive than might be expected in a southern Europe welfare state.

A sample of 5803 advertisements was collected that included 876 primary visual male actors. These were coded and analysed by means of traditional content analysis. A coding scheme was developed which was partly based on existing research. Coding categories included advertisement setting and products; race, social class, age and portrayal of primary visual actor; as well as sexuality, toughness, independence, status, responsibility and homophobia norms of traditional masculinity as related to the primary visual male actor. Hypotheses predicted that men would be represented significantly differently in television advertisements depending upon their race. These differences in representation reflect an intersection between traditional gender and race relations in South Africa that are marked by longstanding inequalities. The findings largely supported these hypotheses. White men are represented as exemplars of hegemonic masculinity whilst black men are marginalised. It is argued that these representations serve to maintain hierarchical social relations between men in South Africa. This study provides a foundation upon which further work may be undertaken.

From the bank robber to the political dissident, the convict in North America is typically gendered male. This masculine association is curious given that the prison emasculates as a form of punishment, depriving the prisoner of independence, agency, money, and heterosexual activity - that is, many of the typical means of male expression in the outside world. Although the prison is typically thought of as a hyper-masculine space characterized by the adage 'might is right', the literature that comes out of it attests to more intricate, complex, and fluid male identities performed and improvised in this space.

Many writers have critiqued the slippage back to sexed bodies underlying various apparently social constructionist analyses of gendered behaviour. Conversely, some poststructuralist and 'Third Wave' accounts of gender have been accused of paying insufficient attention to the role of the material in productions of gender. This article draws on Mikhail Bakhtin's work, particularly his concepts of monoglossia and heteroglossia, as offering an application to gender which addresses such tensions and binaries, recognising both the power and effects of ('monoglossic') binarised accounts of gender, but also the diverse heteroglossia at play in all such productions. It is argued that analysis of monoglossia and heteroglossia in gender performance facilitates the simultaneous 'holding' of recognition of (a) the impact of the material and the discursive in gender construction; and (b) the active work undertaken by dominant, traditional accounts of gender to author themselves as 'real' and total, while also identifying the contradictions and diversity within these productions. The article begins by outlining dilemmas facing contemporary gender theory, and then explaining Bakhtin's work on monoglossia and heteroglossia in language. These concepts are then applied to gender, elaborating how the monoglossic, binary account of gender operates to mask and pathologise heteroglossia; yet how heteroglossia nevertheless exists in all productions of gender. It is argued that Bakhtin's work, in application to gender, offers a sophisticated account that can address existing theoretical binaries, acknowledging the role of thematerial, and of social structures, while simultaneously identifying and celebrating heteroglossic disturbances integral to gender production. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Bakhtin; embodiment; feminist theory; gender; heteroglossia; monoglossia; poststructuralism",,"Francis, B.; The RSA, 8 John Adam Street, London, WC2N 6EZ, United Kingdom; email: Becky.Francis@rsa.org.uk",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

In this paper, we study empowerment of women in families which have experienced the migration of their male members. A direct relationship between migration of a husband and a woman's empowerment is difficult to establish. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile examining whether women have experienced any change in their freedoms in terms of decision making, mobility and restrictions. Our measure of women's empowerment is based mainly on three indicators, viz. their decision-making powers, restrictions placed on them and their mobility. Analysis of these three indices of women's empowerment has been achieved through multinomial logistic regression models on data from India's 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey-3 (NFHS-3). The findings of this study show that out-migration of men has not had a significant impact on the emancipation of women. The common factors which increase the decision-making power and mobility of women and lessen the social restrictions placed on them are age, their educational attainment, marital duration, occupation and residence in urban areas. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","decision making; feminist approach to economics; migration; women's empowerment",,"Sinha, B.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Roorkee, Roorkee-247667, India; email: bsinha08@gmail.com",,,09589236,,,,"English","J.

In the first part of the article, the Myth of Motherhood is conceptualized as a meta-discourse disciplining representations of female agency in political violence. The article then focuses on two specific discourses within the meta-discourse, the Vacant Womb and the Deviant Womb, that inform understandings of gender, agency and political violence in one particular cultural artefact: the British television drama, Britz.

From the early 1920s, Rich became a prominent figure within several Australian feminist organisations and in 1926 was appointed the founding president of the Racial Hygiene Association of NSW, an organisation which espoused eugenics. Although it is often assumed that eugenics is innately anti-feminist, Rich remained an active champion of both feminism and racial hygiene for over 50 years.

This paper discusses thinspiration via an analysis of 1990s grunge culture and its stylisation of subjective crisis. By reflecting on some of the meanings associated with British fashion's figure of 'the waif', it argues that images of extremely slender bodies presented in pro-ana thinspiration menus can be located within a discursive field where distress is a problematic signifier of subjective agency and power. It suggests that although some strategies of the pro-ana community are aligned with the feminist challenge to the dominant gaze and its demand for slender femininities, some images of anorexic distress, such as those found in the category of 'real girl' thinspiration, have the potential to reproduce oppressive representational strategies and sustain a view in which damage to women's bodies is promoted as a source of identity. As thinspiration is produced largely online and by women themselves, this paper calls for a renewed focus on the debate about the impact of slender ideals not only on women as consumers but also as producers of images. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Burke, E.; Cultural Studies, Monash UniversityAustralia",,,08164649,,,,"English","Aust.

The discussion is related to meanings of sexuality for the sake of pleasure (the pleasure ideal) and sexuality for the sake of love (the love ideal). Meanings of sexual relations between boys and men are nuanced in the homosexual press: by providing a variety of descriptions of sexual desire between men and boys, representing the boy as someone who can take both an active subject position and a passive object position in the relationship, and by separating homosexual practices from paedophilic practices. An earlier homonormative ideal or at least a socially sanctioned possibility of relationships between men and boys, as a less equal couple and partner ideal, is gradually replaced though, by a more equal couple and partner ideal based on an expectation of similarity. © The Author(s) 2012.","age; bisexuality; boys; gay press; homosexual press; homosexuality; older men; young men",,"Rosqvist, H.

In recent years, the relational status to children of these men has been subject to increasing legal and research scrutiny. In this article, based on interviews with Australian gay men, the various meanings of biological relatedness to children are explored from the men's perspective. Of particular interest is the difference between a 'donor' and a 'father' for the men, and the extent of their complicity with patriarchal discourses about fatherhood. I argue that, on one level, it is important to distinguish between patriarchal concepts of relatedness that connote entitlement to authority, proprietoriality or legal rights over children, and the various other dimensions of affinity men revealed, including that predicated on biological relatedness. Men's stories often indicated a strong sense of connection to children in the absence of a sense of parental entitlement. I also explore some slippage between 'proprietorial' and 'connected' concepts of relatedness which potentially have negative as well as positive implications for relationships with children growing up in lesbian-parented families and their mothers. © The Author(s) 2012.","Donor insemination; fatherhood; gay men; lesbian mothers; patriarchy",,"Dempsey, D.; Swinburne University of Technology, John Street, Hawthorn, Melbourne, 3122, Australia; email: ddempsey@swin.edu.au",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857947385

The call for 'retraditionalization' of African youth, which is enacted through controlling and monitoring girls' sexuality, is explored. Within this context, four teenage girls from schools in KwaZulu Natal, a province in South Africa, talk about how they understand their sexuality in ways that suggest that girls shatter and then reassemble the heterosexual terrain, through hypersexualized performativity, by 'being girl' in different ways. These teenage girls demonstrate hypervisibility and hypersexuality, and as they resist and subvert hetero-patriarchal cultural contexts, they go beyond projecting hyperfemininty and are largely driven by hedonistic behaviour. Through the use of innovative methodology, where girls are trained to serve as co-researchers to generate and analyse data, power is creatively deployed to enter the heterosexual matrix and find sites which reveal its pliable nature. Ways in which research participants actively resist or comply with heteronormative sexuality are analysed through the conceptual ideas of 'moments of rupture' and 'sustained lines of flight'. © The Author(s) 2011.","Co-researchers; hedonism; hetrosexual matrix; hypersexual; patriarchy",,"Mudaly, R.; University of KwaZulu Natal, School of Science, Mathematics and Technology, Private Bag X03, Ashwood, 3605, South Africa; email: mudalyr@ukzn.ac.za",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857943141

Amongst these readers: adult feminist women. Yet these texts promote regressive understandings of romance, sexuality, and the place of patriarchy, forming what Elena Levine has termed a postfeminist fantasy. Indeed, the stunning success of the texts form one of the most striking manifestations of postfeminist culture in recent years. This article thus questions: exactly what sort of pleasures are feminist women deriving from Twilight? Instead of simply theorizing feminists' relation to Twilight, I sought out two dozen self-identified adult feminists for their own thoughts on their attraction to, submersion within, and problems with the text. Organizing responses around Elizabeth Cowie's theorization of fantasy, the pleasures of girl reading, ambivalence, and affirmation of the feminist project, the article elucidates the distinct pleasures proffered by a postfeminist text. At the same time, it argues that the range of feminist responses to Twilightfrom those who decry the text to those who enjoy itunderscores the difficulties and divisions confronting feminism today. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","ethnography; fantasy; feminist readers; postfeminism; Twilight; vampires",,"Petersen, A.H.; Department of Radio-Television-Film, University of Texas, Austin, United States; email: annehelenpetersen@gmail.com",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

This article argues that these films advocate a retreat into a segregated female sphere; not as radicalisation, but as a space where women monitor each other's drive for physical perfection and/or marriage and motherhood.

Through these strategies, Sea in the Blood is installed as a form of revolutionary activism which comments on the historical pathologization of foreign bodies, and exposes the ways in which the medicalization of race underwrites the medicalized history of sexuality.

While this image appears to promote a revolutionary vision of choice opposing gender stratifications, it responds to the sexual anxieties of a shifting postcolonial context by reconciling women's choices with patriarchal and communalist values. To justify its ostensible ""feminist"" revolution, the imagery draws upon indigenous oppositional traditions of gender portrayal while flexibly utilizing opposition in the services of an inequitable market. Even as the neoliberal canon of (free) women and (unfree) labor is narrowcast on regional-language satellite channels throughout Bengal and its diasporas, this canon is being debated through critical embodiments of women, work, and choice in oppositional-feminist cinema. I look, on the one hand, at televisual adaptations of woman-centered works by a foremost gender-activist of the anti-colonial era, Rabindranath Tagore. The adaptive canon is read in tandem with a widely popular game show on Bengali satellite television called The Earning Homemaker. On the other hand, I consider how oppositional-feminist filmmaker Aparna Sen is undoing the prevalent canon of woman's autonomy in her recent films. My point overall is to explore how we could disentangle the oppositional from dominant neo-humanist communication patterns. I argue that we must situate various depictions of women's ""choice"" within specific relations of power, distribution, and technologies of persuasion-considering what differs and why the differences tend to be elided. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","feminist cinema-India; neoliberalism; sexual politics; television-India",,"De, E.N.; University of California, Riverside, United States; email: de@humnet.ucla.edu",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

Using Angela Davis' theory of the strip search as a form of state-sponsored sexual assault, we assess contemporary uses of whole body scanners by the state and allied corporate interests not only as alleged privacy violations, but also as potential acts of violence by the state on marginalized subjects. By demonstrating the disproportionate impact of whole body imaging technologies on particular communities, including the intersections of transgendered travelers, travelers with disabilities, and racialized and religious communities, we show that whole body imaging technologies continue and expand upon the tradition of stratified mobilities that has always been a component of air travel. We also argue that the alleged non-invasiveness and efficiency of the ""virtual strip search"" marks a troubling trend in which the state consolidates power through increasingly concealed surveillance practices. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","backscatter; feminist; mobility; race; surveillance; technology; transgender; whole body imaging technologies",,"Magnet, S.; Department of Criminology, Institute of Women's Studies, University of OttawaCanada; email: smagnet@uottawa.ca",,,14680777,,,,"English","Fem.

These results support the hypothesis that perceived acceptance from others indirectly contributes to intuitive eating through college women athletes' attitudes toward their bodies. For college women athletes, body acceptance by coaches, trainers, and teammates predicted athletes' own body appreciation, which in turn, predicted their eating style.

In Study 2, we recruited heterosexual women who reported having kissed another woman at a college party. We collected open-ended responses from 77 women via a questionnaire and 27 of these women also completed a semistructured interview. Thematic analyses revealed characteristics of the social context that encouraged this behavior, including pressure to so engage, high levels of alcohol consumption, heterosexist attitudes, and the belief that college is a time for experimentation. A total of seven different motivations for engaging in this behavior were described by participants, reflecting both extrinsic motivations (e.g., to gain male attention) and intrinsic motivations (e.g., to bond with female friends).

Predictions were derived and tested from an evolutionary psychology (EP) perspective, a social-cognitive perspective, and the double-shot perspective. The data were not consistent with the EP predictions because men tended to respond in the predicted manner in only the U.S. student samples, whereas the rest of the data were largely consistent with the social-cognitive theory. Specifically, both sexes tended to be more upset by emotional than sexual infidelity when forced to choose which type of infidelity was more distressing. Both sexes indicated that sexual infidelity was more distressing than emotional when asked to rate their level of distress separately for each using continuous measures. The lesbian and gay samples were mostly consistent with the double-shot hypothesis because they tended to respond based on stereotyping grounded in the sex of their partner, paralleling heterosexuals in this regard. Analysis of the scenarios designed to test the double-shot hypothesis found somewhat smaller effects when the possibility of both types of infidelity was ruled out.

This diversity of needs underscores the necessity for different types of services. In the current study, the authors constructed profiles of Dutch shelter-based abused women (N = 218) based on their reported needs. Further, the authors compared their needs profiles with respect to sociodemographic and social-economic characteristics, abuse type, symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general life satisfaction, social support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, and the attuning of the shelter services to the needs reported. Latent class analysis (LCA) identified four needs profiles: a High Needs class, a Practical Needs class, an Empowerment Needs class, and a Low Needs class. The classes differed with respect to migration, mental health, well-being variables, and the attuning of care needs.

The findings revealed that individuals differed in their relative weighting of each of the four contextual factors. Latent class analysis identified two distinct response profiles: one group reported appearance-related commentary as most likely to trigger an instance of appearance self-consciousness, whereas a second group prioritized self-perceived level of attractiveness as most likely to prompt self-consciousness. On average, the looks-prioritizing group that had higher body mass index were more dissatisfied with their appearance, and felt greater social pressure to conform to appearance-related standards. The use of a discrete choice conjoint design also allowed the authors to investigate the interplay between situational- and trait-based variables in the elicitation of appearance self-consciousness. Their findings suggest that the negative effects of appearance comments and/or perceived unattractiveness on appearance self-consciousness may be offset by access to a friendship network. Furthermore, the finding that individuals differed in their responses to various contextual influences on appearance-related consciousness suggests that a one-size-fits-all model of the relationship between environment and appearance self-consciousness may underestimate the complexity of this relationship.

A sample of 116 Australian female undergraduate students completed measures of self-objectification, self-surveillance, body shame, appearance anxiety, internal body awareness, flow, disordered eating, depressed mood, and sexual functioning. Simple correlations showed that most variables were related as predicted. Structural equation modeling showed an acceptable level of fit of the data to the theoretical model. Nevertheless, predictive ability was considerably greater for disordered eating than for depressed mood, which in turn was greater than for sexual functioning. Appearance anxiety and body shame emerged as the major mediating variables. The findings provide strong evidence in support of objectification theory. In particular, we concluded that self-objectification plays an important role in the development of mental health issues in young women. Accordingly, intervention strategies that target either societal objectification practices themselves, or educate young women to resist the pressures inherent in these practices that lead to self-objectification, have potentially far-reaching benefits. © Society for the Psychology of Women 2012.","body image; depression (emotion); eating disorders; objectification; physical appearance; sexual function disturbances",,"Tiggemann, M.; School of Psychology, Flinders University of South Australia, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; email: marika.tiggemann@flinders.edu.au",,,03616843,,,,"English","Psychol.

We hypothesize several, gender-differentiated design features of psychological adaptations, including sensitivity to adaptive problems for which stalking was an ancestral solution and cognitive biases that function to motivate and perpetuate stalking behaviors.

Female relational stalkers perpetrated elevated rates of moderate violence; however, there were no gender differences for severe violence. Both male and female relational stalkers were more supportive of justifications for female-perpetrated relational violence than male-perpetrated relational violence.

Experiment 1 used a mock-juror methodology in which 177 undergraduates (87 men and 90 women) from a large southeastern US university read a stalking trial summary and rendered individual judgments as mock jurors. The main research question of Experiment 1 was how participant gender impacted trial judgments (e.g., verdict) when the gender of both the defendant and victim were manipulated. Overall, the results showed that men rendered significantly fewer guilty verdicts than women, particularly in conditions that included the prototypical type of intimate stalking (female victim/male defendant). In Experiment 2, also using a mock-juror methodology, 129 undergraduates (51 men and 78 women) from a large southeastern U. S. university read a stalking trial summary (involving a female victim and male defendant) and rendered individual judgments as mock jurors. The main research question of Experiment 2 focused on whether victim fear (high or low) impacted trial judgments (e.g., verdict). The results yielded an interaction of participant gender and victim fear. Specifically, whereas different levels of fear did not impact women, men yielded fewer guilty verdicts in the low victim fear condition compared to the high victim fear condition. The results of the present experiments are discussed in terms of the implications of stalking allegations brought to trial. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender issues; Mock-juror decision making; Stalking",,"Golding, J.

Knowledge work, ICT and worklife balance policies are found to increase the temporal and geographical flexibility of work. Such enhanced flexibility should facilitate women's participation and advancement in work and therefore gender equality. However, all three trends also have hidden gender consequences that significantly prevent women from participating and advancing. Research needs to explicitly integrate evidence from across research areas and disciplines to appreciate the complexity and contentiousness of current workplace developments from a gender perspective.

This presents a practical challenge to face up to non-liberal practices where they do exist, but without demonising an entire faith community. It also raises conceptual questions about mainstream western values. In the context of forced marriage, liberal principles (such as an individual's right to choose their own marriage partner and to decide whether to marry) appear to clash with postcolonial sensibilities including a valorisation of multiculturalism (which might recognise the rights of minorities to practice different marriage customs). These questions are examined through a case study involving Stichting Platform Islamitische Organisaties Rijnmond (SPIOR), a Muslim-identified organisation that works against forced marriage. Based in the Netherlands and active in six other European countries, SPIOR has worked with people potentially affected by forced marriage and also communicated its projects - and the progressive vision of Islam they advance - to wider audiences.

As inherent in their habitus, the social identity of a friend is a way of tackling tourism spaces that accommodate bonding. With friends women feel socially included as tourists and seldom disempowered by the surveillance of the tourist gaze. However, the sustenance of friendships is also about discerning what matters; bonding in holiday spaces contributes to maintaining interpersonal relationships in everyday life. Nevertheless, this social identity also requires that women disidentify with being midlife singles, a strategy which is sometimes problematic. The social identity of the loner is linked to fears of solo holidays. This fear is associated with social exclusion, especially when eating out alone in a resort of an evening. In such spaces women dislike being midlife singles; they feel somehow suppressed by the tourist gaze and become aware of their lack of bonding. The social identity of the independent traveller, however, is about enjoyable solo holidays. It is their way of resisting, contesting and negotiating tourism as about sociability with significant others, thereby transforming habitus and manoeuvring the tourist gaze in public holiday spaces, such as restaurants. It is additionally about positive identification with being a midlife single woman. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender; holiday; identities; intersectionality; power","gender relations; social exclusion; tourism; womens status; Norway","Heimtun, B.; Finnmark University College, Follumsvei 31, 9509, Alta, Norway; email: bente.heimtun@hifm.no",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858836085

I begin by situating this politicized debate in the everyday material contexts of the public square, the street, and the mall. By introducing popular culture (notably the film Büşra) and my own fieldwork on the veil, I argue that the headscarf represents the intersection of politics of place and individual agency in a way that renders ideological debates contingent on everyday practices. Reducing the headscarf to a sign of Islamism fails to take into account the ever-shifting meanings of this object across time and space. The differences within and between the everyday urban sites I examine reveal much more complex, often contradictory, and discontinuous geographies of secularism and Islam. This analysis reveals a multiplicity that belies attempts to delineate clearly bounded spaces, subjects, and ideologies, one that is intimate and political. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","everyday; feminist geopolitics; headscarf; Islam; secularism","cultural conflict; geopolitics; ideology; Islamism; state role; Istanbul [Turkey]; Turkey","Gökariksel, B.; Department of Geography, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3220, United States; email: banug@email.unc.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858805395

In exploring these women's transitions I seek to understand why women who had either never previously been sex workers or who were sex workers operating without duress, but who were then trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation remain in, or re-enter volatile forms of migrant sex work at a later point under voluntary arrangements. In answering this question I focus on the temporal and spatial aspects of individual women's experiences in migrant sex industries drawing in detail on the narratives of two Thai women trafficked to Sydney, Australia and Singapore. I make some suggestions about methodologies used in trafficking research that can assist in bringing to light some of these complex time-space dimensions of women's experiences through their shifting positions in commercial sexual labour. The article also reflects on the implications of these women's trajectories for the 'prostitution debate' as it relates to trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation by suggesting that many trafficked women occupy ambiguous or in-between positions in migrant sex industries, neither easily distinguishable by the label of victim of trafficking or migrant sex worker. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","commercial sexual labour; methodologies; migration trajectories; sex trafficking; Thailand","cross-border relations; exploitation; migrants experience; prostitution; trafficking; womens status; Australia; New South Wales; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Sydney [New South Wales]; Thailand","Yea, S.; Department of Geography, National University of Singapore, 1 Arts Link, Kent Ridge, Singapore 117570, Singapore; email: salliellao@gmail.com",,,0966369X,,,,"English","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858806402

While managers and females have begun to view women as possessing managerial attributes, male students, on average, still tend to stereotype the managerial role using a pro-male bias. Based on research by Heilman and by Lord and Maher, the purpose of this paper is to propose that business students, who are exposed to a curriculum that emphasizes the importance of diversity, as recommended by AACSB, will exhibit fewer gender stereotypes. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Schein Descriptive Index, three groups of university students were surveyed to determine whether individuals exposed to formal management education experience a reduction in ""men as manager"" stereotypes. The hypothesis was tested using interclass correlation coefficients (r′) from two randomized-groups analysis of variance. Findings: The hypothesis was not supported and the findings indicate that students in the business administration program stereotyped the managerial role to a greater degree than those not enrolled in the business administration program. Research limitations/implications: Further studies should be conducted to determine if the findings of this particular study are universal across college campuses. Practical implications: Business schools must evaluate the methods that are being used to teach diversity in management education. Originality/value: The authors' unique approach focuses on the sample as an important element when studying gender bias in management. Given the state of the economy and the cuts to university programs, by determining where bias occurs, diversity education in the university environment can be better utilized for optimal impact. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business studies; Diversity management; Gender; Managers; Stereotypes; Students; United States of America; Universities",,"Paris, L.

While writing about sexually transmitted disease under other auspices permits Dixon to broach a topic considered unfit for discussion by women, this article nevertheless contends that The Story of a Modern Woman is not simply a coded novel, wherein the circulation of tuberculosis implies nothing other than the virulence of syphilis. The novel's naturalistic settings, which include vitiated airspaces and filthy surfaces in and out of doors in urban London, recall environments deemed liable by nineteenth-century germ theory to harbor tuberculosis bacilli. These pathogenic surroundings critique the harmful conditions to which women were subjected by male-dominated institutions.

By crediting humor with shifting women's attitudes on marriage, Ella Hepworth Dixon reframes humor as a social catalyst rather than a private, cathartic coping mechanism. Building upon humor theory ranging from founding fathers such as Sigmund Freud and Henri Bergson to feminist critics such as Linda Hutcheon and Regina Barreca, this article shows how Dixon uses humor to interrogate marriage as both a social institution and a literary convention. If the marital imperative threatens to stunt women's growth, then Dixon's humor provides an inoculation. Dixon's overlooked first novel, My Flirtations (1892), suggests that when women laugh together at marriage's expense, they render it expendable. Moreover, women's social progress depends not just on financial security, but on the critical perspective and sisterhood that a keen sense of the ridiculous provides. This deceptively light-hearted novel retaliates against late nineteenth-century misogynist humor and redefines comedy as the New Woman's domain. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"Smith, A.T.; Department of English, University of Connecticut, Unit 4025, 215 Glenbrook Road, Storrs, CT 06269-4025, United States; email: amanda.t.smith@uconn.edu",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862942094

Specifically, it argues that Dixon isolates the doctor and the dandy as particularly threatening to the New Woman. Though these roles constitute radically different identities, she shows how they similarly confront the New Woman's feminist politics and stand in the way of her desire for intellectual, social and sexual equality. Dixon also gestures to more positive versions of masculinity, even if they are not fully realized in the novel. Many New Women, especially eugenic feminists and social purists, imagined a New Man who could be on equal terms with the New Woman. Such a figure is largely absent from Dixon's novel, though the artist Perry Jackson comes closest to New Manhood. Jackson's status as an artist frees him from conventionality, though his growing commercial interests challenge his non-conformity. Dixon's decision to avoid such an idealized relationship for Mary ultimately demonstrates her commitment to rejecting traditional love plots in favour of a more realistic mode. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"MacDonald, T.; Department of English, University of Amsterdam, 201 Spuistraat, 1012 VT Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: T.C.MacDonald@uva.nl",,,09699082,,,,"English","Women's Writ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856059732

Such challenges had subversive potential, and New Woman writers needed to adjust their works to be favorably received.

Ella Hepworth Dixon's efforts to do both complicate the portrayal of her female character Mary Erle in The Story of a Modern Woman (1894). In certain editions of her novel, Dixon makes her character more acceptable by fashioning her like the photographs in periodicals that feminize the educated woman and the woman writer. These revisions in her fiction include tempering the education her heroine receives.

Focusing on one of Western Europe's few non-EU member countries, the article compares how two Norwegian social movement organizations draw on gender issues in their argumentation. The analysis is empirically based on written material produced by the organizations and takes recourse in a feminist methodological approach rooted in the tradition of discourse analysis. The analysis suggests that gender-related issues discussed by the organizations are coloured by an implicit North-South hierarchy which frames some areas, nations and cultures as more gender-equal and women-friendly than others. By drawing on notions conceptualized by Nira Yuval-Davis, it is argued that social movement organizations' tendency to frame women's issues and gender-equality in a way that implicitly marks and maintains symbolic boundaries between North and South is coloured by a 'politics of belonging' at the macro-level. The final discussion suggests some of the ways in which it may be problematic to see Nordic gender-equality traditions and current EU initiatives as universal solutions that fit all women living in Europe. © The Author(s) 2012.","Diversity; Nordic; North-south divide; Politics of belonging; Social movement organizations",,"Bygnes, S.; University of Bergen, Department of Sociology, Rosenbergsgaten 39, 5015 Bergen, Norway; email: Susanne.bygnes@sos.uib.no",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

Ignoring class as a factor in the violence produced by the gentrification of urban spaces, the pitting of the (implicitly white) gay community against the (implicitly straight) Muslim community posits the latter as a threat to the continent's foundations that needs to be contained through forms of spatial governance in line with the neoliberal restructuring of the city.

Simultaneously, with activist groups like the queer of color collective Strange Fruit, it is also representative of the strategies of resistance developed by groups whose presence is virtually erased through culture clash discourses, namely queer Muslims. The article argues that an intersectional queer of color activism, as practiced by Strange Fruit, and a queer of color critique building on it, allows to undermine binaries from the Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative, invariably positioning queers of color as 'not properly gay'. © The Author(s) 2012.","Anti-Muslim racism; Creative city; Homonormativity; Netherlands; Queer of color",,"El-Tayeb, F.; University of California, Department of Literature, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0410, United States; email: feltayeb@ucsd.edu",,,13505068,,,,"English","Eur.

This reality has been a long-standing source of frustration for survivors, victim advocates, as well as members of the criminal justice system. To address this problem, communities throughout the United States have implemented multidisciplinary response interventions to improve post-assault care for victims and increase reporting and prosecution rates. One such model is the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program, whereby specially trained nurses (rather than hospital emergency department [ED] physicians) provide comprehensive psychological, medical, and forensic services for sexual assault victims. The purpose of this study was to examine whether adult sexual assault cases were more likely to be investigated and prosecuted after the implementation of a SANE program within a large Midwestern county. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare criminal justice system case progression pre-SANE to post-SANE. Results from longitudinal multilevel ordinal regression modeling revealed that case progression through the criminal justice system significantly increased pre- to post-SANE: more cases reached the ""final"" stages of prosecution (i.e., conviction at trial and/or guilty plea bargains) post-SANE. These findings are robust after accounting for changes in operation at the focal county prosecutors' office and seasonal variation in rape reporting.

No time period effect was identified for marital name plans in the Midwest samples. Women were neither more nor less likely to plan to retain their birth name in 1990 as compared to 2006. A time period effect was found for attitudes: Midwest women in 2006 were more likely to say a woman was more committed to the marriage if she took her husband's last name as compared to Midwest women in 1990. This indicates that women in the Midwest may have become more conservative over time. We also found regional differences: women in the East were significantly more likely than women in the Midwest to plan to keep their birth surname upon marriage. Findings suggest a trend toward more conservative attitudes over time and location although plans, perhaps due to the rareness of maintaining a birth surname upon marriage, have not changed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Attitudes; Marital naming; Plans; Region; Time",,"Scheuble, L.

Participants were 48 men and 33 women from the Midwestern United States who had been identified as gifted in mathematics and science and participated in a high school science enrichment program. They ranged in age from 24 to 28 years old, and the sample was predominantly White (83.3%). Participants completed an online measure approximately 10 years after the program ended examining their sources of support and beliefs about the self as a scientist to see how these variables influence perceptions of a science career and actual career. We expected that the relationship between perceived support from people and current job held would be mediated by participants' beliefs about their personal life as a scientist in the future. Similarly, we expected that the relationship between a perceived supportive environment and having a science career would be mediated by participants' beliefs about their career as a scientist in the future. Findings indicated that social support contributed directly to men's and women's ability to envision themselves in a future science career, which, in turn, predicted their interest in and motivation for a science career.

First, we agree that the various constructs that we termed ""math attitudes""-including math-gender stereotypes, math anxiety, math self-concepts, and achievement motivation in math-are in fact distinct (Gunderson et al. 2011b). Nevertheless, we argue that investigating common mechanisms underlying the transmission of these constructs from adults to children is a productive approach because it can lead to general interventions to boost children's performance and dispositions toward math. Second, we argue that research on the development of gender-related math attitudes exists at the intersection of multiple research areas, including research on attitudes (broadly defined), math, gender, social learning, and child development, and that drawing on well-developed theories in these areas can lead to novel research questions and predictions. The three excellent commentaries broaden the scope of our article on gender-related math attitudes to include the transmission of implicit attitudes from adults to children, stereotype threat, and gender roles in math-related careers (Cheryan 2011; Gunderson et al. 2011b; Lane 2011; Shapiro and Williams 2011). © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender stereotypes; Math; Math anxiety; Math attitudes; Parents; Teachers",,"Beilock, S.

The aim of the present study was to examine if gender stereotypes about academic abilities that are usually considered as fully demonstrated in the literature have to be updated. Three hundred ninety-eight French fifth graders from a medium-sized provincial town answered a questionnaire designed to examine, both with direct and indirect measures, if they hold different gender stereotypes concerning mathematics and reading depending on target's age (children vs. adults). As expected, results showed that participants, regardless of their gender, were aware of a math-ability stereotype favorable to men when the stereotyped targets were adults. When the stereotyped targets were children and young adolescents, the math-ability stereotype was less clear. Participants believed that people think that girls succeed as well as boys in math. Concerning reading-ability, participants reported the ""usual"" stereotype favorable to females, regardless of the stereotyped target's age (child or adult). Together these results suggest that academic gender stereotypes have to be reconsidered. The math-ability stereotype targeting children and favorable to both genders seems to show an improvement of the French girls' reputation in mathematics. Moreover, the reputation of French boys in this domain seems to be poorer than reported in previous research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Academic abilities; Children; Gender stereotype awareness; Math; Reading",,"Martinot, D.; Laboratoire de Psychologie Sociale et Cognitive, UMR CNRS 6024, Clermont Université, Université Blaise Pascal, 34 avenue Carnot, 63037 Clermont-Ferrand, France; email: delphine.martinot@univ-bpclermont.fr",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856527577

Although men were more likely than women to plan to pursue science, this gap in students' intentions was completely accounted for by implicit stereotypes. Moreover, implicit gender identity moderated the relationship between women's stereotypes and their academic plans, such that implicit stereotypes only predicted plans for women who strongly implicitly identified as female.

Of the 111 countries investigated, our findings suggest that countries where gendered languages are spoken evidence less gender equality compared to countries with other grammatical gender systems. Furthermore, countries where natural gender languages are spoken demonstrate greater gender equality, which may be due to the ease of creating gender symmetric revisions to instances of sexist language. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Gender equality; Gendering Language; Grammatical gender",,"Prewitt-Freilino, J.

Consolidating large numbers of new believers into viable communities has presented great challenges to Bahá'í institutions, including in Chinese communities. Since the late 1990s, a new pattern of discourse and practices has emerged with the aim of nurturing a sustainable pattern of Bahá'í community building. One aspect of this approach has been a critique of a congregational religious culture, which implies boundaries between believers and nonbelievers, leaders and laypersons, and private religiosity and community service. Instead, an approach centered on study, devotion, and action in small groups at the grassroots is becoming the focus of Bahá'í communities. This article compares the dynamics of small group community building among Bahá'ís in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland China, and the evolving relationship between small groups and Bahá'í electoral institutions characterized by practices of religious citizenship at the local and global levels. The study illustrates the localization of a global religion in three different Chinese sociopolitical contexts. © 2013 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.

Prompted by their success in the new entrepreneurial world, these elite male Christians strive to gain spiritual prestige and moral superiority in the Chinese church by employing a spiritual narrative of their post-Mao economic success and by articulating and spreading a new vision that they call ""God's China vision."" In active response to the Chinese state's nationalist discourse of modernity, they are convinced that China will rise not only in the economic sphere but also in the spiritual realm and will transform itself from a missionary-receiving country to a missionary-sending one. The paper links this grass-roots project of spiritual nationalism to a redemptive process in which elite Chinese Christians seek to address and overcome victimization and suffering inflicted by secular state modernity. It concludes that post-Mao Christian development has come to be closely connected to national memories and nationalist imagination, countering the party-state's insistence on secular nationalism. © 2013 M.E.

There are many new types of agents coming in and playing very active roles in this social sphere, which effectively blurs the old boundaries that characterize its previous contour. Corresponding to the arrival of these new agents, the central dynamics of Daoism and its articulation with the wider society appears to have drifted away from political/ideological control toward economic/commercial development.

Dramaturgically speaking, the strong female characters portrayed in these texts disrupt the stasis of the play with their immoderate behavior and therefore drive the plot forward. Although the plays do not all explicitly call for fat actresses, within the texts there are subtle semiotics that connect the excessive behavior of the character with her body type. These examples suggest that Williams capitalizes on cultural fears and prejudices concerning the (fat) female body and use associations explicitly linked to fat/consuming women to create characters who embody “fat behavior,” and thus contribute to dramatic conflict within the play. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fat behavior; Fat dramaturgy; Feminism; Tennessee Williams; Theatre",,"Mobley, J.-S.240 Court Street #4, United States; email: jen-scottm@nyc.rr.com",,"Routledge",21604851,,,,"English","Fat Stud.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947778351

The cultural and socioeconomic contexts of fatness in Germany are analyzed and some differences between Germany and the United States in confronting fatness are pointed out. One difference is identified in Germany’s National Socialist past that influences political jargon in Germany up to the present time in that rhetoric even remotely resembling Nazi rhetoric is inacceptable as official jargon. Open argumentation for the fitness of the masses along the lines of Foucault’s governmentality is thus highly critical, and political campaigns implementing governmental strategies remain vague. When arguing against fatness, German official jargon tends to resort to constructing the fat person as a threat to collective resources, be it the health care system, the disability insurance system, or the national economy at large.

However, implicit in this criticism is that a better indicator of body fat would be acceptable as a means of separating unhealthy fat people from healthy thin people. In fact, measures of body fat percentage are readily available and are not superior to the BMI as indicators of health risks. The BMI was developed as an index of overall body size by removing the influence of body height on body weight. Using height and weight data on 1,034 major league baseball players, the usefulness of the BMI is illustrated in two scatter plots. Height and weight are clearly related, whereas height and BMI are completed unrelated. Epidemiological studies are reviewed that have determined BMI and percent body fat in relation to death rates and risk factors. In no instance is percent body fat superior to BMI in predicting risk, and BMI is actually more closely related to risk factors than is body fatness. Thus, excess muscle mass or large body size may be a significant predictor of disease that is captured by BMI.

We examine the implications that the queering of straights has on understandings of gender and sexuality, arguing that, whether the context is a sporting event or a dance hall, social terrains rely on a body of assumed knowledge that helps construct the social meanings inculcated in and performed by moving bodies.

Exposure to violent videogames was, as expected, correlated with aggression. Endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology was also correlated with aggression. The endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology was found to moderate the relationship between exposure to violent videogames and aggression. High endorsement increased the positive linear relationship between exposure and aggression, whereas low endorsement removed this relationship. © 2012 by the Men's Studies Press, LLC.","aggression; exposure to violent videogames; moderation; traditional masculinity ideology",,"Thomas, K.D.8215 Theota Ave., Parma, OH 44129, United States; email: Thomas.kim16@yahoo.com",,,10608265,,,,"English","J.

The views of female sexuality expressed in the blog are to be understood as the antithesis of those presented in the novel. In this article, I take seriously the suggested connection between Bitchy and Bridget Jones, suggesting that these two female diarists have more in common than Bitchy might wish to acknowledge. Both use a variety of rhetorical strategies to create the impression that they are giving an authentic account of a marginalised subject position, and use this 'authentic' voice to denounce mainstream and subcultural attempts to exclude as worthless or irrelevant aspects of their sexual tastes, practices and experiences. I investigate the feminist potential and risks of this use of the authentic as a political weapon and conclude that, while claims to authenticity are problematic, the very fact that we debate these varying subject positions opens up new ways of thinking about female sexual subjectivity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","authenticity; Bitchy Jones's Diary (blog); Bridget Jones's Diary (novel); female heterosexuality; feminism; post-feminism",,"Handyside, F.; Department of Modern Languages, College of Humanities, University of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom; email: f.j.handyside@exeter.ac.uk",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

Situating them, briefly, in relation to previous erotic memoirs and fiction by women, I examine their transition from blog to book and consider the impact of new digital technologies upon female sexual self-narration. I examine the texts in the light of recent popular feminist writings on the sexualisation of girls and young women, and analyse both the books and original blogs' engagement with feminism, and their treatment of romance, lesbianism and the regulations governing female sexual conduct. This article evaluates the extent to which the boom in women's erotic memoirs (in book or blog form) is symptomatic of a persisting belief in sexuality as the truth of identity. Sexuality, as it is figured here, is still being positioned as 'the secret', as the essence or core of subjectivity, which perhaps explains why the memoir, as an attempt to communicate and constitute a 'self' through writing, has for women increasingly become the erotic memoir. This article concludes by asking to what extent this is both an undervaluation and an overvaluation of sexuality for women. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","erotic memoirs; female sexuality; feminism; lesbianism; romance; self-narration; sex blogs; subjectivity",,"Mitchell, K.; Department of English and American Studies, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; email: kaye.mitchell@manchester.ac.uk",,,19419899,,,,"English","Psychol.

A Foucauldian perspective reveals that for these women, crime, drugs, and prostitution were expressions of resistance against extreme states of domination and abuse. Through crime and deviance, these women struggled against socioeconomic deprivation, physical, and sexual abuse and other forms of domination and injustice perpetrated by the family and criminal justice system. In crime, drugs, and prostitution, these women managed to express their will and autonomy. These women's testimonies may shock and scandalize-yet they break through oppressive norms and traditions that had, so far, been taken for granted.

The principles and social practice relating to women's appearance in public space for religiously-sanctioned purposes were interwoven, resulting in complicated and ambiguous situations. In order to explore the principles as well as the practice of religiously sanctioned gendered spaces over time, three venues will be visited: the communal prayer, studying and teaching, and the Islamic shari'a court.

T5 depressive symptoms emerged as the most robust predictor of all domains of sexual functioning. Different patterns of correlates were associated with the different domains of sexual functioning-a finding that highlights the importance of considering the multidimensional nature of human sexuality. In addition, several significant gender × predictor interactions indicated differential relationships between predictors and sexual functioning outcomes for men and women. In particular, concurrent physical health and mental health were more strongly related to sexual functioning for women compared with men.

Use of VA services was higher among transgender veterans (transvets) than published rates of VA use in the general population of veterans (annual 6.2% to 15.8%), with 16.3% of all transvets seeking some VA care in the past 6- months. The most common physical health problems treated at the VA in the past year were high cholesterol, blood pressure, and vision problems. Irrespective of VA use, the majority of transvets reported getting routine health care (88.4%), and their physical health ratings were commensurate with population norms. Mental health services (e.g., depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and gender identity counseling) were also utilized (9.3% VA, 25.6% non-VA) at levels consistent with the relatively low mental health functioning scores in this sample (SF-12 = 32.6, SD = 8.3). Barriers to care were endorsed more for medical than mental health treatment. In particular, transvets were concerned about medical providers' reactions to their gender identity or sexual orientation.

Half experienced at least one completed sexual assault during their lifetime. Most (68%) reported sex was important in their lives, and three quarters (74%) indicated that they had engaged in sex with a partner during the past 6 months. Almost one quarter of sexually active participants reported painful sexual intercourse, and approximately one third (35%) acknowledged using lubricants often to make sex comfortable. Mental health disorders (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance use disorder), gynecologic injuries resulting from completed sexual assault, and poor health-related quality of life were common in this sample and were associated with compromised sexual functioning. Most sexually active women endorsing these correlates were more likely to report not being emotionally satisfied with their main partner. Problems with sexual functioning and pain during intercourse were associated with even a single completed lifetime sexual assault (cLSA). These correlates should alert health care providers to inquire regarding sensitive topics such as LSA exposure and other factors (e.g., painful sex, same-sex partners, and mental health).

A total of 415 veterans newly registered to the Veterans Health Administration (VA) completed measures of demographic, mental health and physical health-related diagnoses and symptoms, including questions specific to sexual functioning. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to examine associations between mental and physical component scores and sexual functioning problems. Age, hypertension, pain, depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse were included as covariates. Findings indicated that sexual dysfunction had a strong negative effect on the SF-36 Mental Component Summary (MCS) scale after adjusting for multiple physical and mental health characteristics. Although a number of covariates were significantly related to the MCS scale, sexual functioning problems exhibited a unique contribution to mental wellbeing. This study highlights the presence of sexual dysfunction in this rather young veteran cohort and its significant negative overall impact on wellbeing.

They may become challenging when one partner's gay, lesbian, or bisexual orientation is revealed unexpectedly during a long-term relationship, and the G/L/B partner wishes to act on his or her same-sex attractions, or the straight partner cannot come to terms with the revelation. Awareness and disclosure of same-sex attractions are often delayed due to the cultural and personal effects of homophobia and biphobia. Couple therapy can help these couples by helping them to understand the different experiences and therapeutic needs of the partners, sorting through and addressing the underlying relational issues brought out by the conflict, providing education and resources, and offering possibilities for redefining the relationship. The therapist should be aware of the diverse outcomes that can result and be prepared to facilitate the negotiation of changes. Successfully creating a sustainable relationship depends on the quality of the relationship before disclosure and both partners' willingness to focus on reconstructing the relationship. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual; gay; lesbian; mixed-orientation marriage; therapy",,"Bradford, M.; Private Practice, 925 The Alameda, Berkeley, CA 94707, United States; email: mbradfordphd@gmail.com",,,1550428X,,,,"English","J.

Themes revealed included the wives' anger, betrayal/disillusionment, self-esteem, isolation, denial, and self-blame. Dealing with these and the dual disclosure led to various resolutions.

Misunderstood and marginalized, straight wives become collateral damage. Grieved, disoriented, confused, fearful, and often enraged, their trust and security are shattered. Their self-esteem is damaged and they feel shamed and isolated. Kaye, whose husband of 39 years came out, wrote: ""I am 63 years old and feel like an infant, trying to rebuild a personality and a life from scratch.""Based on direct interviews and correspondence with hundreds of female straight spouses over a 15-year period, this study addresses their unique issues.

Many disclose, causing trauma for their straight spouses. Since 1969, studies have examined closely the experience of every category of spouses involved, except straight husbands. This study aims to fill that gap by examining self-reports of 183 heterosexual men, married or previously married to lesbian or bisexual women, to identify their major feelings, issues, coping strategies, and multidimensional personal growth. The phenomenological study used four different data sets. The findings demonstrate that the straight husbands felt deeply, shared emotions with others, and cared for their wives. They also worried about their children's well-being and parented actively. The men coped in diverse ways, found outside support (mostly from peers), and reported personal growth in many dimensions. Their experience mirrors previous research conducted with straight spouses in general and also suggests unique characteristics of straight husbands, including some behaviors that contradict stereotypical assumptions about men in crisis. Knowing and understanding straight men's experience after their wives come out as lesbian or bisexual may enable straight husbands to cope more effectively and family members, friends, and professionals to provide more helpful support to men in these circumstances. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","coming out; coping with trauma; masculinity; mixed-orientation marriages; straight spouses",,"Buxton, A.

In an Internet survey, we examined relationship satisfaction, parenting stress, sexual orientation disclosure, and gay identity among these men, all of whom had become fathers in the context of heterosexual relationships. Results showed that gay fathers who were currently married to women reported lower relationship satisfaction, affection, consensus, and lower overall dyadic adjustment in their current relationships. Formerly married gay fathers who were currently single or currently in relationships with male partners reported greater openness about their sexual identities than did still-married gay fathers. The men who were currently in relationships, however, did not report differences in relationship cohesion or parenting stress as a function of partners' gender.

When they later confront the conflict between their same-sex desires and their marriage, they reopen fundamental identity questions. These queer spouses share with other people who come out in adulthood the problems of renegotiating identity in adulthood and achieving a queer identity in a heteronormative culture. In addition, their attempt to reformulate adult identity is made problematic by the fact that they often cannot make sense of their experience in terms of dominant cultural scripts about love, desire, and commitment. Specifically, the essentialist script for understanding sexual desire and the monogamy script for understanding love and commitment put the queer man's straight marriage and his same-sex desires in contradiction: to have a coherent identity, one or the other must be denied. Queer spouses can overcome this contradiction by entering ""unscripted territory"" and constructing new ways of understanding their desires and relations. Therapists can be of help to queer spouses by providing an ""unscripted space,"" giving emotional support for the difficulty of ""not knowing,"" and questioning assumptions derived from dominant scripts. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adult identity; gay married men; mixed-orientation marriage; straight spouse",,"Swan, T.

There are several findings about the influence of this model in cases of sexual harassment suffered by women in the workplace (Mackinnon, 1979; Thomas & Kitzinger1997; Wise & Stanley 1987) as well as hegemonic masculinity and homophobia at the school (Mac an Ghaill 2007). In this paper we will present evidence on both issues but also on overcoming process derived from the research project entitled Impact of communicative acts on the construction of new masculinities funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation. The research illustrates the influence of communicative acts on the promotion of new masculinities, far removed from the hegemonic one, which are based on values like equality and solidarity. We will present some data about how specific communicative acts can favour the recognition and visibility of new masculinities in the workplace and the School, specifically in a Small and Mediumsized Enterprise, an Adult Education centre and Vocational School. © 2012, Hipatia Press.

Tensions are explored between the role of the magazines in constructing male consumers to deliver to advertisers, and the dispensing of genuine health advice. Tensions are particularly apparent when health advice would go against typical images of hegemonic masculinity, for example advice to drink less alcohol, eat less meat, eat less convenience food, or reduce involvement in risky behaviour. The conclusion considers whether in constructing a male consumer, which in itself threatens traditional masculine images since it involves an interest in fashion, shopping and grooming products, there is potential for magazines to compromise health advice by avoiding further threats to traditional masculinity. © 2012, Hipatia Press.

The rich anthropological literatures on ‘home’, ‘sexuality’ and ‘work’ have been oddly remiss in addressing the issue of masculinity and domestic work. More often spoken for than speaking, the life of a servant has an indistinct quality that begs attention. Using biography as a method to frame life lived as a male servant I suggest that a ‘servant biography’ is completed only in a subsequent life with which it is linked, imaginatively and substantively. Further, the historiography of servitude positions the female worker as the principal actor, so that the template upon which an understanding of domestic work is built is feminine. Additionally drawing on the literature on veiling and gender, I set myself the task of retrieving the male servant. © 2012, Hipatia Press.

The first section shows that this tension is most clearly illuminated when we consider how the qualities of fat – as well as the act of fattening – have related to classical ideals about masculinity. The second offers examples of how references to Spartan ‘hardness’ have been cited since the eighteenth century as methods of restoring otherwise ‘soft’ males to a more appropriately vigorous mental and bodily state. Without arguing for an unbroken or unproblematic continuity between ancient and modern culture, it suggests that classical references represent what Pierre Bourdieu sees as ‘the product of an incessant (and thus historical) work of reproduction’. © 2012, Hipatia Press.

The prevalence of informal sector employment and absence of paid work-family reconciliation measures magnify these supply-side constraints.

The article tests hypotheses on household context and paid working conditions as determinants for men' and women' absences from employment. The empirical analysis is based on selected waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) between 1985 and 2001. The results of ordered probit estimations confirm that women' and men' sickness absences were related to both working conditions and household context. The findings thus indicate the potential empirical relevance of the ""double burden"" for German women and men. The stereotype of higher absences of women due to family obligations does not seem to fully represent the actual behavior of German employees, at least for the 1985-2001 period. However, the relative importance of specific working conditions and the relative importance of household structure versus amount of time spent in household production differed between men and women. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender effects; household characteristics; job characteristics; ordered probit estimation; Sickness absences",,"Beblo, M.; Berlin School of Economics and Law, Badensche Strasse 52, Berlin, 10825, Germany; email: pirmin.fessler@oenb.at",,,13545701,,,,"English","Fem.

Two important changes were the 1992 elimination of the official policy permitting discrimination against homosexual service members, and the 1996 introduction of benefits to same-sex partners. These changes radically influenced the psychological day-to-day reality of lesbian and gay military members. Yet, given the military culture, lesbian and gay members only began to come out in significant numbers at the turn of the century. This article presents an overview of our experience with researching the history of lesbians and gays in the Canadian military during the late 1990s and early years of the new century. It reveals the early clandestine nature of our research, and recounts some of the trials, tribulations, resistance, and successes we encountered when dealing with ethics boards and funding sources. It also describes our relationship with the media and how the military actively took steps to stall our efforts.

This article proposes two new models of a definition using principles of social psychology. Each model (a) utilizes the premise that gender lacks a categorical essence and (b) separates behavioral adherence to cultural stereotypes of femininity and masculinity from one's gender self-categorization. From these premises, I generate and critique two internally coherent models of lesbian identity that are inclusive (to different degrees) of various gender identities. For each model, the potential inclusion of trans men, trans women, genderqueers, and lesbian-identified cisgender men is evaluated. The explanatory power of these models is twofold. One, the models can serve as theoretical perspectives for scholars who study the intersection of gender and sexual identity. Two, the models can also characterize the everyday experience of people who have tacit working definitions of lesbian identity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cisgender; gender; genderqueer; identity; lesbian; transgender","article; control; female; gender identity; human; human relation; identity; lesbian; perception; psychological aspect; psychological model; self concept; social behavior; social psychology; Female; Gender Identity; Homosexuality, Female; Humans; Identification (Psychology); Internal-External Control; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Psychological; Self Concept; Social Conformity; Social Identification; Social Perception; Stereotyping","Tate, C.

Populationism, which Joni Seager defines as 'the dogma and the rhetoric of population alarmism and population control,' subtly legitimized efforts to control and marginalize poor women's bodies in the context of welfare reform. The populationism underlying welfare reform hinges on a deep fear of engulfing social chaos if 'we' do not check the fertility of poor women, and particularly women of color. This article historically situates contemporary welfare politics by tracing in some detail how Malthus' original writings on population were constitutively linked to debates about 'poor relief' in early nineteenth century England. Exploring the gendered linkages between Malthus and social welfare policy in the 1800s allows us to understand how Malthus continues to haunt discourses about social welfare in the 1990s and beyond, with direct consequences for poor women and particularly poor women of color. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender; Malthus; populationism; USA; welfare reform","fertility; gender relations; Malthusian theory; population growth; social history; social policy; welfare reform; United States","Kaufman, E.; Department of Geography, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, United States; email: eckaufma@syr.edu",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928097212

It thus seeks to extend recent work on the ways in which the ideas of race and relatedness are being shaped by recent accounts of human genetic variation and evolutionary history within human population genetics by exploring the gendered and sexual imaginaries of this field. At the same time, it seeks to extend feminist geographical work on social reproduction by attending to the figuring of reproduction itself. The article focuses on accounts of the geographies of Y-chromosome variation and the differences between the geographies of Y-chromosome variation and mitochondrial variation, and explores the degree to which this work is underpinned by, and potentially reinforces, particular accounts of gender, sex and the reproductive strategies of women and men. More specifically, I argue that despite some differences between the perspectives of those involved, much of this work deploys a model of male sexual competition that is at the heart of claims about the universal and determined fundamentals of reproduction, and indeed all social life, within evolutionary psychology.

Specifically, I interrogate two gendered figures with which I was repeatedly confronted over the course of researching cougar-human relationships on Vancouver Island, home to what is estimated to be North America's densest population of cougars. The first figure, Cougar Annie, was a woman 'settler' on western Vancouver Island, reputed to have killed over 100 cougars in her lifetime and now celebrated as a strong, independent female. The second figure is a contemporary trope, an older woman who expresses interest in younger men, known in slang speech as a 'cougar'. Both figures are intimately bound to a third figure, the animal cougar, Puma concolor, whose material-semiotic relationship to humans both performs and is performed by 'cougars' and Cougar Annie. Haraway's conception of figures as embodied and performative mappings of power is central to this article's discussion, which lies at the intersection of animal studies, more-than-human geographies, posthumanism, and feminist science studies. Methodologically, I draw on interviews and archival research to trace the historical and contemporary specificities of these two figures - Cougar Annie and 'cougars' - revealing how they are informed by, and simultaneously produce, uphold, and perform, gendered understandings of the relationship between humans and cougars, predator and prey, humans and animals, and culture and nature. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","animals; cougars; figures; gender; Haraway; posthumanism","gender identity; womens status; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver Island; Animalia; Puma concolor","Collard, R.-C.; Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, V6T 1Z2, Canada; email: rcollard@geog.ubc.ca",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922686215

Quantitative studies suggest that Albanian internal migration is pioneered by men, with women merely acceding to their wishes. This article addresses the undervalued role of women in the academic discourse concerning migration in Albania. Utilizing ethnographic research techniques, it explores the role of women migrating from rural to urban areas as part of a larger household and examines the coping and negotiating strategies used for survival in the city. Our findings reveal that women actively participate in the rural-to-urban migration process, including the initial decision to migrate and the choice of destination. Women's narratives provide evidence of specific emancipation strategies through which they express themselves and their new ways of living. Women adjust to and challenge their new urban environment through gaining paid employment and expanding their social networks, as well as experience emancipation through daughters and by changing their appearance, achieving varying degrees of personal and social prosperity. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Albania; emancipation; migration; rural-to-urban; women","employment; internal migration; labor migration; rural-urban migration; womens status; Albania","Çaro, E.; Faculty of Spatial Sciences, Population Research Center, University of Groningen, Landleven 1, 9747 AD, Groningen, Netherlands; email: e.caro@rug.nl",,,0966369X,,,,"English; Spanish","Gender Place Cult.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922685564

Analysis of in-depth interviews with four participants shows two significant findings. First, immigrant career women experience a frustration-negotiation cycle while finding their ""place comparable to the past"" in the United States. Second, they first go through a social identity challenge and then subsequently through a cultural identity challenge. © 2012 Asian Center for Women's Studies.","Acculturation; Asian immigrant career women; Identity negotiation; Narrative identity; Narrative method; Storytelling",,"Yoon, G.",,"Ewha Womans Unversity",12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

However, women at the margins, stigmatized by intersectional sex hierarchies, do not have the language to express themselves. Certain former sex workers want to keep their past experience as something 'that cannot be spoken of.' This is the consequence of internalizing the fear of external stigma rather than self-negation. For these women, narrative identity can be thought of as an excessive pressure. Then how can they express themselves? By analyzing the images of the photographs taken by a former sex worker, this study compares the possibilities and limits of self-expression through narrative and through photography. Also, this study investigates how the woman discovers a 'different' possibility to reveal and convince herself of her life through the act of photographing. As objects of the photograph, the red light district women become contained in the objectified representational image by the power of the gaze. However, photographing functions as an act of image production; it reveals the gap of regulation and partitioning enforced by the existing discursive power. While an active resistance may not be possible, the metonymical self-descriptive acts of capturing the adjacent time and place of one's life can become a possibility for females at the margins to traverse the intersectional sex hierarchy. © 2012 Asian Center for Women's Studies;.","Gaze; Photography; Politics of identity; Red light district; Representation; Self-description",,"Kim, A.-R.; Asian Centre for Women's StudiesSouth Korea",,"Ewha Womans Unversity",12259276,,,,"English","Asian J.

Using an integration of Grounded Theory and Consensual Qualitative Research qualitative methodologies, results indicated that fathers reported being involved in their child's health through encouraging healthy eating and exercise, monitoring their child's well-being and development, and understanding their child so they know how to respond when their child becomes sick.

Using multivariate logistic regression, a model was developed to differentiate older male suicide decedents who used firearms from those who used other suicide methods. The results show that the presence of a health problem at the time of death was one of the best predictors of suicide with a firearm. Place of suicide (predominantly rural) and veteran status further increased likelihood of firearm use among older men.

The more important the female partner was in influencing the decision to stay home, the lower the levels of masculine characteristics and the more enjoyment men reported in being a stay-at-home father. Future research should focus on comparisons of paternal involvement in stay-at-home and other fathers, the reasons men decide to become or not to become stay-at-home fathers, and the factors that influence those reasons, such as their partners' attitudes and experiences with prejudice and discrimination. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Characteristics; Employed fathers; Fathering; Gender role attitudes; Stay-at-home fathers",,"Anderson, V.N.; Department of Psychology, Indiana State University, Terre Haute, IN 47809, United States; email: vanderson1@indstate.edu",,,15249220,,,,"English","Psychol.

However, hormonal contraception interferes with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and modifies internal milieus. Macrophages depend on the milieu to which they are exposed. Therefore, we assessed whether macrophage function would be affected by the use of combined oral contraceptives (OCs) and if this influence depended on the androgenic or non-androgenic properties of progestin. Methods. Healthy adult women were enrolled and stratified into two groups: women who did not use OCs (Fs) and women treated with OCs (FOCs). FOCs were further stratified as a function of androgenic (FOCA+) and non-androgenic (FOCA-) properties of progestins. Routine hematological, biochemical, inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction parameters were measured. Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were evaluated for the expression and activity of estrogen receptors and androgen receptors, and release of tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) was measured from unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells. Results: As is already known, the use of OCs changed numerous parameters: the number of lymphocytes, iron levels, total iron-binding capacity of transferrin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein increased, while prothrombin time and alkaline phosphatase decreased. Hormonal levels also varied: cortisol was higher in FOCs, while luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and testosterone were lower in FOCs. Asymmetric dimethylarginine, an index of endothelial function, was lower in FOC than in Fs, as were cysteine and bilirubin. The androgenic properties of progestins affected the activity of OCs: in particular, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein and calcium were higher in FOCA- than in FOCA+, whereas percentage oxygen saturation and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase were lower in FOCA- than in FOCA +. Importantly, FOCs had a lower global DNA methylation, indicating that OC may have epigenetic effects on gene expression. OC did not modify the expression of androgen receptor but increased estrogen receptor expression, more considerably in FOCA+, and decreased estrogen receptor β, more considerably in FOCA-. Importantly, the activation state of estrogen receptor βin FOCs was decreased, while estrogen receptor α was not active in either Fs or FOCs. Unstimulated MDMs obtained from FOCs showed higher release of TNFα in comparison with Fs. After lipopolysaccharide stimulation, the release of TNFα was significantly higher in Fs than in FOCs. Conclusions: OC use induced many changes in hematological and plasmatic markers, modifying hormonal levels, endothelial function, inflammation index and some redox state parameters, producing a perturbation of the internal milieu that impacted macrophagic function. In fact, different levels of estrogen receptor expression and release of TNFα were observed in macrophages derived from OC users. Some of the above activities were linked to the androgenic properties of progestin. Even though it is not known whether these effects are reversible, the results indicate that to avoid potential skewing of results only a single type of OC should be used during a single clinical trial. © 2012 Campesi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","androgenic and non-androgenic progestin; combined oral contraceptive; estrogen receptors; global DNA methylation; monocyte-derived macrophages; TNFα","alkaline phosphatase; androgen receptor; bilirubin; C reactive protein; calcium; chlormadinone; cholesterol; cysteine; desogestrel; drospirenone; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor beta; follitropin; gamma glutamyltransferase; gestagen; gestodene; hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein; hydrocortisone; iron; levonorgestrel; lipopolysaccharide; luteinizing hormone; n(g),n(g) dimethylarginine; oral contraceptive agent; testosterone; transferrin; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; unindexed drug; adult; article; controlled study; cytokine release; DNA methylation; drug use; endothelial dysfunction; female; human; human cell; iron binding capacity; iron blood level; leukocyte count; lymphocyte count; macrophage; macrophage function; monocyte derived macrophage; normal human; oxygen saturation; priority journal; protein expression; prothrombin time; side effect","Campesi, I.; National Laboratory of Sex-Gender Medicine, National Institute of Biostructures and Biosystems, Osilo, Italy; email: ilacampesi79@yahoo.it",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",20426410,,,,"English","Biol.

The paper identifies strategic building blocks for defining a set of different growth platforms. Moreover, the paper investigates growth ambitions for women inside each identified ""type"" of growth platform and identifies critical motivation variables that can influence the decision to move from growing one business platform to growing another platform. Design/methodology/approach: The results are based on 191 women entrepreneurs. Data were analyzed by coding narrative statements from the survey into overarching themes for business platforms, descriptive frequency analysis and logistic regression analysis techniques. Findings: The paper discerned five different growth platforms and noticed intrinsic or extrinsic growth ambitions for platform growth. The extrinsic platforms are the most common, but all platforms can be characterized by equally high growth aspirations. Each of the identified platforms is associated with distinct and unique blocks that the women entrepreneurs try to put together and resolve in order to grow their companies. Women entrepreneurs move between the different platforms when the building blocks of previous platforms have been established and secured. Variables such as profits and ownership may explain such transfers of growth ambitions. Research limitations/implications: While acknowledging the qualitative growth of business platforms, the paper takes an approach that goes against the traditional view of quantitative growth. Originality/value: This study is a response to the lack of research on qualitative growth and women's entrepreneurship and suggests that the manifested qualitative growth can be in order to secure blocks on different business platforms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business platforms; Entrepreneurialism; Gender; Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; Qualitative growth; Strategic building blocks; Women's entrepreneurship",,"Dalborg, C.; Department of Social Sciences, Mid Sweden University, Östersund, Sweden; email: cecilia.dalborg@miun.se",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17566266,,,,"English","Int.

Qualitative data were subjected to content analysis using NVivo8. Findings: Most respondents were growth-oriented, well educated and employed prior to start-up. Clients employed the Centre for three reasons, including acquisition of managerial, social capital and gender-related motives. The Centre was perceived as being ""different"" to other agencies such that staff implicitly understood their needs as businesswomen, services were targeted specifically to women and clients felt empowered and comfortable seeking business advice in an inviting, low risk learning environment. Findings contradict studies and argument that targeted (gender-based) programming offers few advantages.

Design/methodology/approach: Using data gathered from 3,420 university students in more than ten countries, and applying the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test, differences between genders and different intention groups were examined. To reduce the items regarding educational needs, factor analysis was used. Gender differences in educational needs were also examined via Mann-Whitney Test. Findings: The results confirm that compared to males, female students are less willing to start their own businesses. There are significant gender differences in terms of perceived feasibility and perceived desirability such that although they feel more supported by their families, females are less self-confident, more tense, reluctant and concerned about entrepreneurship. In terms of entrepreneurial intention, there are fewer gender differences among students; however, differences relating to self-confidence and family support still exist. Furthermore, students cited establishing entrepreneurial mentoring and an appropriate tutoring structure as the most needed entrepreneurial educational activity/program/project at an academic institution; this was rated higher by females compared to males. Practical implications: The findings of this paper could help guide educators and policy makers in designing effective entrepreneurship programmes that are customized to respond to gender specific needs to increase entrepreneurial participation.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies logistic regression techniques to data drawn from a comprehensive survey of Australian small- and medium-sized businesses, which was conducted in 2010. Findings: After controlling for a wide range of firm, owner and risk characteristics, female entrepreneurs are found to have lower growth aspirations than males but do not differ in their demand for business finance.

In the first place, I will sketch the mode of functioning of ""government"" with reference to the pastorate invented by the Christian Church, showing that the theme of government and of its historical origins appears for the first time when Foucault talks about the disciplinary powers of normalization of 19th-century psychiatry. In the second place, I will approach directly the logic of strategy that makes intelligible the relationships between government and discipline. Finally, these two concepts will be included in what Foucault called the double modern political rationality, and the persistence of this topic, in different forms, in many of his historico-philosophical analyses, and above all as the two sides of what he famously called bio-power. The main claim is that the relationship between the concepts of governmentality (the effect of which is totalization) and discipline (the effect of which is individualization) is neither one of conceptual incompatibility nor one of chronological succession in the development of Foucault's thought, but rather a relation of interdependence that needs to be pointed out and further articulated in order to understand and pursue a critique of modern political reason.","Discipline; Governmentality; Gramsci; Modern political reason; Subjectivity",,"Savoia, P.; Departamento de Historia de la Ciencia, Harvard UniversityUnited States; email: savoia@fas.harvard.edu",,"Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia",0123885X,,,,"English; Spanish","Rev.

Biop ower emerges in the transition from disciplinary societies to societies of security as the articulation of two technologies: the anatomopolitics and biopolitics. Sex is the hinge that links the two axis along which the political technology of life is developed. It is related to the disciplining of the body (the domestication, intensification and distribution of its strengths) and with the regulation of the population. Sex translates the ""political energy"" as well as ""the biological vigor"" of a society. Nonetheless, Foucalt insists on leaving sex and desire aside in favor of the issue of the role of pleasures. These arguments by Foucault have been problematized by various feminist theorists. On the one hand, they denounce the masculine character of his rhetoric, the androcentrism of his perspective and the pessimism of his vision. On the other hand, they help inspire new analyses of the technologies of the body which make visible the specific gender differences, as well as the possibility to build new political projects in support of the emancipation of women.","Biopolitics; Bodies; Cyborgs; Feminism; Sexuality; Worlding",,"Boyer, A.; Departamento de Filosofía, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana en BogotáColombia; email: amaliaboyer@gmail.com",,"Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia",0123885X,,,,"English; Spanish","Rev.

The postmodern condition proclaims pluralism, difference, heterogeneous perspectives, the specificity of individual cases, and the little stories ignored by modernity. The postmodern critique has exposed the false certainties of modernity, possibly making us wiser but lacking alternatives. The processes of modernization and post-modernization have made it possible to turn in on ourselves, critically placing us between our needs and our rights. In this context, a new social vision has emerged around the critical importance of the phenomena of subjectivity and the construction of the subject. Contemporary critical pedagogy, which is especially concerned with emancipation, was founded on the old ideals of the Enlightenment and developed with modern narrative categories. After the postmodern critique and the recognition that social practices have changed profoundly, we need to conceive of emancipatory pedagogy in new ways in order to allow the subject as much protagonism as possible. This implies a profound transformation of education, which can no longer be considered merely in terms of the economic and productive development of society.","Critical Theory; Educational reform; Educational Theory; Emancipation; Postmodernity",,"Guerrero, A.

The article also considers the heuristic value of these equivocations for thinking about the regimes of the large slave plantations of the Americas. Does slavery describe a relation of power or a state of domination? What distinct analytical and ethical implications would this distinction have upon examining the problem of freedom under subjugation? Through a careful exegesis of two late instances in the work of the French thinker, ""Subject and power"" (1982) and ""The ethics of care of the self as a practice of freedom"" (1984), this article identifies the conceptual ambiguities that accompany his brief observations on slavery, and takes them as a starting point for highlighting a series of moments in which games of power during the period of slavery in the Americas show the limits that were intuited, yet not theorized, by Foucault; limits which are no other than extreme violence and death. This is exemplified through a discussion of certain paradoxes in the phenomena of the fugitive slaves (cimarronaje) and of the aporias, that were manifested through the uses of the Christian pastoral as a means of subjection at the beginnings of the Cuban slave plantations during the 18th century - and in dialogue with their symbolization in art.","Christian pastoral power; Fugitive slaves; Power relations; Resistance; Slavery; States of domination",,"Lugo-Ortiz, A.; Departamento de Lenguas y Literaturas Románicas, Centros de Estudios Latinoamericanos, Estudios de Genero y de Estudios de Raza, Politica y Cultura, The University of ChicagoUnited States; email: lugortiz@uchicago.edu",,"Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia",0123885X,,,,"English; Spanish","Rev.

The reform moved the crime to a different chapter of the Penal Code: from the chapter on crimes against sexual freedom to the chapter on crimes against personal autonomy and individual freedom. This legislative change means that the crime is not only limited to cases of forced prostitution but also applies to cases of consensual sexual exploitation. Based on a case study, the aim of this article is to analyze how the legislative change has altered judicial practice.

These possibilities enabled the State to create, and at the same time, control citizens' bodies, in various ways and among diverse social groups. Hygienic practice brought together international scientific knowledge with regional efforts toward homogenization, as well as national and local needs for differentiation. In order to study these links, the text focuses on the interaction between the hygiene discipline, its professionals, the international networks of knowledge exchange, and the principal hygiene mechanisms that were introduced to manage the population.

This had two important consequences. First, it led to discord and two wars, the closure of the media, and the exile of political leaders. Second, it encouraged the union of the Liberals and Historic Conservatives into a single party, the Republican Union, whose goal was to struggle against the discord created by the 1886 Constitution and the presidencies of people like Miguel Antonio Caro and Rafael Reyes. To do so, it promoted the constitutional reforms of 1910 and the consecration of the Exception of Unconstitutionality.","Balance of powers; Constitution of 1886; Constitutional reform of 1910; Exception of Unconstitutionality; Presidential system; Republican Union",,"Chaves, M.

Recent estimates put the number of Chinese emigrants at 40 million people. Far from being a homogenous group, members of the Chinese diaspora have diverse economic, cultural, social, educational, and personal backgrounds as well as very different life stories and emigration experiences. Despite the growing interest in the Pacific Rim and the constant immigration of Chinese to the Americas through the 20th century, there is very little information about their migration to Colombia. This article explores the topic from a historical point of view in order to fill this void. The little that is known about Chinese migrants to Colombia is presented in the context of a discussion on the diaspora in order to highlight the transnationality and multiplicity of identities among this migrant group. The article also examines the similarities and differences between Chinese migration to Colombia and other countries in Latin America and on other continents, relating these particularities to local contexts.","Chinese diaspora; Identity; Migration",,"Fleischer, F.; Antropología Cultural del Graduate Center, City University of New York, Departamento de Antropología, Universidad de los AndesColombia; email: f.fleischer406@uniandes.edu.co",,"Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia",0123885X,,,,"English; Spanish","Rev.

The article starts by tracing the attention that Foucault gave towards the transformation of the Providential, omnipresent, and biopolitical State, to one that is satisfied with introducing an environmental technology that no longer governs through the subjection of individuals, but through a ""disinvestment"" that creates the conditions for the same subjects, now as entrepreneurs, to be in charge of resolving conflicts and contradictions. I use some ethnographic vignettes to understand the actualization of this ""disinvestment"" that ends up producing and maintaining ""zones of social abandonment."" Specifically, I am interested in understanding how this ""disinvestment"" occurs within a State transformation that through the mandates of participation and decentralization, makes these subjects into agents responsible for their own development. Lastly, I suggest that this ""zones of social abandonment"" can also be zones of desire that go beyond what might be called a low intensity biopolitics. I use the example of the Peace Community of San José de Apartadó and their antagonistic practices that are currently challenging these technologies.","Biopolitics; Foucault; Internally displaced; Participation; Zones of social abandonment",,"Aparicio, J.

Thus, the article focuses on two chronologically and analytically disperse instances in Foucault's work: on the one hand, his early reflection on the relation between madness and literary language, and on the other hand, his late reflection on the cynics' way of life in ancient Greece, and on the political dimension of the practice of a certain ""truth-telling"" (parrhesia) characteristic of the bios cynikus. From these two instances, the article seeks to highlight how in each case the notion of ""ethical subjectivation"" seems to become insufficient to take into account the ethical-political effects of these practices with language.

This document, written by an anonymous author - probably a Pseudo-Longinus, a Greek exiled from Rome - would become, after its translation into French by Bileau (1674), a determinant starting point for the introduction to modern aesthetic reflections on the experience of the sublime. This paper presents a journey that seeks to analyze the rhetoric treatise ""On the Sublime [Peri hypsos]"" by Pseudo-Longinus, highlighting those places where the sublime, in its most classical presentation, is already related to some of the most interesting traits of its rise as a modern aesthetic category, foreshadowing the twist it will acquire in contemporary interpretation. The motivation is to corroborate, from a specific interpretative reading of Pseudo-Longinus' text, how the path towards aesthetics originates in classical rhetoric and to show that the history of aesthetics has inherited a question that has particular resonance in contemporary thought: the question surrounding how language, image, and work of art can only be presented or represented in the vague limit between what is shown and what is hidden, making evident, and transforming into experience, the limits of their own communicability.","Aesthetic; Pseudo-Longinus; Rhetoric; Sublime",,"López, M.

A majority of participants did not recall a sustained conversation about sex. Rather, they recollected fragmented, random, and often context-free comments their mothers made about sex. Three themes emerged from analysis of interviews: (a) negative messages, (b) feelings of discomfort, and (c) mother as role model. In addition, a minority of participants who experienced open and honest mother-daughter sex talk reported it had benefited them, whereas daughters who did not experience rich mother-daughter sex talk wished they had and believed it would have made them stronger women and enhanced closeness with their mothers. Standpoint theory offers insight into why many Black mothers might find sex talk uncomfortable and might warn daughters of negative aspects of sex while not mentioning positive aspects.

In this literature the direction of change is decided in advance, assumed to emanate from above and conceptualized as moments fixed in time. As a consequence, it is argued, the rich processes of change enacted through time, which seek to take account of the motives of those involved, are elided. It is further argued that change is more appropriately understood as contested than as consensual, and that civil society is implicated in processes of public sector change in the organizations affected. An attempt is made accordingly to analyse the presence of civil society influences through social movement processes in universities, as organizations that are not social movements. Arguments are considered for and against the status of the new public management as a social or managerial movement, which is taken to be a coalition rather than a social movement, acting as the organizational glue of many neoliberal regimes.

It draws on an interview study of Finnish social and healthcare workers to argue that the expectations towards men and women in the reorganized field of care work are different, especially in the case of their emotional involvement in care practices. The article develops a conceptual framework based on Bourdieu's theory of practice and its feminist developments. We discuss caring as gendered, habitual and emotional work and as a lived social relationship that produces different states of autonomy and dependency for women and men. Our study finds that women in particular face contradictory expectations of being intensely involved in emotion work on the one hand and in the efficient performance of tasks on the other, which creates a clash between their habitus and the field of care work. We further suggest that the clash produces social suffering that is difficult to recognize because the practices in the field reproduce and reaffirm the differences in the emotional habitus of men and women. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agency; Care; Emotions; Gender; Habitus","conceptual framework; gender issue; health care; health worker; neoliberalism; public sector; social work","Husso, M.; Department of Social Sciences and Philosophy, University of Jyväskylä, PO Box 35, 40014, Finland; email: marita.husso@jyu.fi",,,09686673,,,,"English","Gender Work Organ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83255187314

There is a general lack of information on diverse expressions of sexuality among diverse groups of bisexual men in the United States. Researchers collected data on a wide range of variables related to sexual behavior from a sample of 26,042 participants, recruited via a large social and sexual networking Website. Four distinct typologies of male bisexuality were constructed: self-identified bisexual, bisexual dating, bisexual with current sexual partners and bisexual by behavior. These categories were examined individually as well as compared and contrasted with one another. Demographic characteristics varied among men depending on bisexual categorization. Although participants that identified as bisexual within each typology often met criteria for other categories for other typologies, there was no absolute overlap between categories. The recency and frequency of sexual behaviors significantly varied based upon the participant's bisexual typology. Findings suggest that previous research on bisexual men's sexual behaviors and sexual risk behaviors may be misleading if bisexuality is restricted to a single typology. Further research should examine the potential subjective meanings and health implications of diverse typologies of male bisexuality, beyond sexual risk. Comprehensive and insightful research on aspects of life other than disease infection and transmission among bisexual men will help to ensure a more accurate understanding of male bisexuality in a comprehensive sexual health framework. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bisexual men; bisexuality; men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW); sexual behavior; sexual experience; typologies",,"Dodge, B.; Department of Applied Health Science, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University, 1025 East 7th Street, HPER 116, Bloomington, IN 47405, United States; email: bmdodge@indiana.edu",,,15299716,,,,"English","J.

Drawing on recent theoretical work on the bisexual body, this article explores the implications of the femme fatale's bisexual behavior for a critical understanding of embodied bisexuality in relation to narrative film. The author extends her interrogation of the bisexual femme fatale beyond the current critical discourse that views the bisexual behavior of this figure simply as a means of demonstrating an assumed universal availability. Taking Femme Fatale (2002), Bound (1996), Basic Instinct (1992) and Mulholland Drive (2001) as her examples, the author argues that these films engage with wider narratives and anxieties about the correlation between bodily actions, desires and identities. In this article, the author argues that the behaviorally bisexual femme fatale's refusal of a conflation of current object choice with sexual orientation provides vital space for a bisexual feminist questioning of sexuality and desire as attributes that are written on the body. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","feminism; femme fatale; film; popular culture; representation",,"Farrimond, K.; Newcastle University, School of English Literature, Language and Linguistics, Percy Building, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 7RU, United Kingdom; email: k.m.farrimond@ncl.ac.uk",,,15299716,,,,"English","J.

Firstly, it demonstrates how queer groups located in France re-translated 'queer made in the USA', inspired by continental philosophy, back into a French idiom in the mid-1990s. It then seeks to explain their contemporary responses to new trends and agendas in queer studies and politics that sound more and more compliant with 'logics of disempowerment'. The re-sexualization and re-politicization of French post-structuralist philosophers and psychoanalysts such as Foucault, Deleuze, Derrida and Lacan, made possible by American queer theory and cultural studies, have been succeeded by a phase in which American theorists seem to crave the traditionally European privilege of being lauded as public intellectuals. At the beginning of the new century, a violent recodification by straight scholars and institutions took place and is still taking place in France: queer and post-colonial studies are dismissed or banned as subjective, unscientific agit prop. Today's benevolent researchers reaffirm their power through powerlessness and 'identify' with the victims they defend. In this context, recent American queer theory and politics can give the impression of being driven by a logic of disempowerment. To illustrate this, Judith Butler's Gender Trouble is compared with her Undoing Gender. Thus where Gender Trouble promoted strategies of resignification and resistance for both gender expression and hate speech, Undoing Gender displaces the strategy of resignification from hate speech to what could be called 'master words' such as 'the universal' and 'the human', and this 'neo-universalism' is linked to a politics of vulnerability. Moreover, whereas in Gender Trouble, textual or discursive performativity is impersonal and reversible, in Undoing Gender, the continental European figure of the philosopher is back. To counter this development, to pursue a strategy of dis-identification with the nation state and the United States, to quit the politics of vulnerability or desperation and to reverse the disempowering effects of the neo-assimilationist agenda, the article proposes a specifically French alternative. This consists of seeking to insert a queer version of what Félix Guattari calls 'micropolitics' into the macrocultural agenda of the LGBT right. © The Author(s) 2011.","American queer theory; cultural translation; Félix Guattari; French queer theory; Judith Butler; politics of disempowerment",,"Bourcier, M.-H.; Université Charles de Gaulle-Lille 3, Domaine universitaire du 'Pont de Bois', Rue du Barreau,BP 149, 59653 Villeneuve d'Ascq Cedex, France; email: mariehelene.bourcier@univ-lille3fr",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856454092

This article argues that Genet's contentious decision to articulate homoerotic desire within the space of a heteronormative language is one necessitated by the structural constraints of language itself. Metafictively drawing attention to the absence of a language in which to communicate homoerotic desire, Genet represents his narrators and characters as locked in a closet of heteronormative language. His strategic response to this silencing is to appropriate and recontextualize heterocentric and homophobic discourses in ways that problematize their assumed heteronormativity. In contrast to the gay critical focus on whether Genet himself has internalized heteronormative assumptions about his sexuality and subjectivity, Genet's texts remind us that the question is not simply an individualized one of what the author him/herself thinks, but rather how s/he might articulate expressions of desire within a language that seems designed to erase such expressions of difference. © The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.","French literature; homophobia; Jean Genet; language; proto-queer; recuperation",,"Stephens, E.; Centre for the History of European Discourses, University of Queensland, Forgan-Smith Building Level 5, Queensland, 4072, Australia; email: e.stephens@uq.edu.au",,,13634607,,,,"English","Sexualities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856450775

The article considers issues around capital, experience, and the extent of exclusion/inclusion for boffins/geeks, discussing to what extent such young people can be considered marginalised and abjected or agentic and privileged. We argue that structural factors such as gender, social class, 'race', age, and institutional location impact on these constructions and outcomes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","achievement; identities; popular culture; queer theory; sociology",,"Mendick, H.; Department of Educational Studies, Goldsmiths, University of London, London, United Kingdom; email: heathermendick@yahoo.co.uk",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858806620

The study explored: (1) the complexity of sociolinguistic and feminist identity construction in multilingual seascapes, and by extension (2) how feminist educators' interpretation and enactment of their personal world-view informs their language teaching in terms of what they teach, how they teach, and why they teach what they do. The participants who hail from a diverse range of ideological landscapes were identified either by themselves or others as feminist teachers. Through a suite of data sources which comprised autobiographical essays, interviews and lecture observations, this paper explores how the female teacher's educative and pedagogic expertise and interactions are framed in relation to her race, gender, and age. Accepting the fluidity and complexity of identity positionalities, the paper explores the identity constructions of the feminist teachers in their communities of practice. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","critical pedagogies; critical race theory; identities; pedagogy; race and ethnicities",,"Perumal, J.

A case study approach is used to explore how five women who are studying physics at a Swedish university simultaneously negotiate their doing of physics and their doing of gender. By conceptualising both gender and learning as aspects of identity formation, the analysis of the interviews with the five women offers insights into the nuances and complexities of how women relate to the gendered disciplinary culture of physics. This contrasts how research on gender and physics education has been predominantly concerned with comparisons of female and male students' attitudes and/or achievements. Furthermore, the analysis brings to the fore how it is not just the masculine connotations of physics that shape the experiences of the five women, but also the expectations on female physics students. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","gender; higher education; identity; physics; science; situated learning",,"Danielsson, A.

A group of us in the programme found ourselves repeatedly referring to a time when we had worked together in a research project and the absolute joy we had experienced working together. We decided to write this reflection as the story of the W(h)ine Club, a space in which we complained, drank lots of wine, laughed and researched. All at the same time! What we realised was that women academics working together was a wonderful way to do research. Sharing our joys and sadness was often the glue that kept the team together and we learnt about research without realising it.

The latest evaluation of PE in Sweden shows that more boys than girls ranked the subject highly and that they had a higher level of activity during the PE lessons. Drawing on a case study, the aim of this article is to illuminate how games placed girls and boys in different subject positions. The logic governing the observed lessons was 'proper game', i.e. playing according to the official rules. Combined with hegemonic masculinity and the passivity of the teacher, this kind of logic resulted in the game being dominated by several dominant boys and by the ball-playing girls either being positioned or allowing themselves to be placed in situations in which they consistently underperformed. A gender category in late modernity, resting on hegemonic masculinity, can be seen as a cultural flashpoint that reflects problems in society rather than problems in the gym.","Body; Embodiment; Gender; Hegemonic masculinity; Learning; Physical education; Subject position; Subjectivity",,"Fagrell, B.; Department of Sport and Health Sciences, The Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, Box 5626 S-11486, Stockholm 11486, Sweden; email: birgitta.fagrell@telia.com",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858855154

We argue that EFT can be effectively used with Latina immigrants as long as therapists take into consideration the complexity and cultural context of their lives. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","feminist therapy; Hispanic women; Latina immigrants; multicultural counseling",,"Díaz-Lázaro, C.

While these differences may reflect reality, we argue that survey data must be interpreted cautiously and with an understanding of the cultural, economic, and political context in which the information is collected as well as methodological differences between the surveys. © The Author(s) 2012.","comparative research; culture and measurement; domestic abuse; Mexico; partner violence","adult; article; battered woman; comparative study; ethnology; female; Hispanic; human; information processing; male; Mexico; partner violence; poverty; risk; risk factor; sexuality; United States; urban population; Adult; Battered Women; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Male; Mexican Americans; Mexico; Poverty; Risk; Risk Factors; Sexual Partners; Spouse Abuse; United States; Urban Population","Frías, S.

To address this issue, gender and age group differences in media and interpersonal influences on body dissatisfaction were assessed among early and middle adolescents living in Chongqing, China. In Study 1, 595 boys and 648 girls completed self report measures of demographics, public self-consciousness and appearance-based social pressure, comparisons, and conversations. Compared to boys, girls reported more appearance pressure from mass media and close interpersonal networks (friends, family), appearance comparisons with peers, and appearance conversations with friends; these effects were qualified by interactions with age group, indicating media and interpersonal factors were more prominent in the lives of middle adolescent girls than other groups. Effects were observed independent of body mass index (BMI) and public self-consciousness. In Study 2, 738 girls and 661 boys completed the same measures and a body dissatisfaction scale. By and large, gender and age differences were replicated. Middle adolescent girls also reported more body dissatisfaction than peers did. Perceived appearance pressure from mass media and interpersonal ties were both implicated in mediation analyses to explain this gender × age group effect. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adolescents; Appearance pressure; Body dissatisfaction; China; Gender",,"Jackson, T.; Key Laboratory of Cognition and Personality, Southwest University, Chongqing, China; email: toddjackson@hotmail.com",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155172723

The current study sought to classify and describe young adult participants' narratives on their heterosexual identity development using Worthington et al. (2002) heterosexual identity status model. Participants included 1,051 heterosexually-identified undergraduates (632 women; 419 men) from two public universities in the western United States who provided written narratives about their sexual identity development. Responses were analyzed for levels of identity exploration and commitment, which were used to create five identity status categories. The majority of participants described identity commitment with passive exploration, with more men in this category than women. A significant subset of participants described identity commitment with active exploration, with more women in this category than men. Smaller numbers of participants described active exploration without commitment, unexplored commitment, and identity diffusion. More women were in the active exploration without commitment status than men; no gender differences emerged in the other two statuses. Participants classified into statuses with active exploration and higher commitment also evidenced higher scores on quantitative measures of sexual identity exploration and commitment, respectively. Men evidenced higher quantitative scores than women on identity commitment; there were no gender differences in the quantitative assessment of identity exploration.

This holds true for management and leadership positions in particular, which could be explained by the lack of congruence between the female gender role and leader role. Therefore, the theoretical framework underpinning this study is based on role congruity theory. The research question is whether the share of women on the board and among members influences the perceived severity of organizational problems faced by sports organizations. This postulation is examined for a representative sample of sports clubs in Germany (n = 13,068). Analyses of variance are conducted with the severity of organizational problems and the share of women on the board and among club members. The results show that the share of women on the board and among members has a significant negative impact on the severity of organizational problems. Sports clubs with a high share of women on the board and among members perceive the severity of organizational problems as smaller on average. This finding is related to female leadership style, which might serve as one possible explanation. Based on these results, it is recommended that sports clubs appoint more women to management positions.

Seventeen pathological women gamblers (13 of whom were mothers) were recruited from three addiction treatment centers in Israel, and participated in semi-structured interviews. Three central themes emerged during analysis: maintaining control over the gender roles-putting child raising and housekeeping duties first despite their gambling habits; control over the choice of gambling venue-gambling far from their home, or where they knew the owners; and moral control-steering clear of immoral behaviors in spite of their addiction to gambling. Further analysis reveals how pathological women gamblers who are also mothers make rational choices that help them juggle between their gender roles and gambling, to minimize the social costs that might be incurred by their gambling habit. Moreover, presenting the gambling behavior as more moral than theft or prostitution enabled them to normalize their behavior. The study's findings show how the decisions and choices made by the women in this study are shaped by the socio-cultural context in which they are made. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Control; Motherhood; Pathological gambling; Rational choice; Women",,"Gavriel-Fried, B.; The Bob Shapell Scholl of Social Work, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel; email: belfried@bezeqint.net",,,03600025,,SROLD,,"English","Sex Roles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84155160670

African American, Latino, and White fathers (N=426) from research sites across the United States, were interviewed about their caregiving, play, literacy, and visiting activities when their children were 2 years, 3 years, and preschool age. Fathers of boys engaged more frequently in physical play than fathers of girls, whereas fathers of girls engaged more frequently in literacy activities. Moreover, gendered patterns of father engagement were already evident at the 2-year assessment, suggesting that fathers channel their children toward gender-typed activities well before their children have a clear understanding of gender roles. Ethnic differences were also found in fathers' activities with children, and child gender moderated ethnic patterns of behavior. For example, Black fathers of sons reported the highest levels of engagement in caregiving, play and visiting activities, and both Latino and African American fathers of sons engaged in more visiting activities compared to White fathers of sons. Fathers' education and marital status were also associated with fathers' activities. Married fathers and those with a high school diploma more frequently engaged in literacy activities than unmarried fathers without a diploma; moreover, although Latino fathers engaged less in caregiving activities than African American and White fathers, this difference attenuated after controlling for differences in fathers' education. The activities children share with their fathers vary by child gender, race/ethnicity, and family circumstances and offer insight into early gendered experiences in the family. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Child development; Culture; Daily routines; Father involvement; Fathers; Gender socialization",,"Leavell, A.
